My life is very diverse, and my friends are a diverse group of people.","Anna Deavere Smith":"President Obama called for a 'we' nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes.

Then there will be people who watch the show that want to get in and hands-on make outfits.","George Lucas":"'Star Wars' is fun, its exciting, its inspirational, and people respond to that. It's what they want.","Damien Rice":"Inside, I've got a real purist desire and dream about the music.

It means I've done my job.","Molly Ivins":"'Get along, go along' is not an inspirational philosophy, and only God knows how much moral cowardice it has covered up over the years.

I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.","Matthew Prior":"Hope is but the dream of those who wake.","Honor Harger":"We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.","Michael Gove":"The single most important thing in a child's performance is the quality of the teacher. Making sure a child spends the maximum amount of time with inspirational teachers is the most important thing.","Maysoon Zayid":"I'm not here to impose Sharia law, and I'm not here to have a message about disability being inspirational - I'm here to make people laugh.

Does a person have global sensibility? That's the hardest thing to find.","Petra Collins":"We work to create a new wave of feminism that is more inclusive. I want others to feel equal.

Kelly":"I am very conscious of who I am as an artist and as an inspirational person.","Jeffrey Tambor":"I worked at The Old Globe Theater under the great baton of Craig Noel. One of the great theater heroes that we have. He was so great and so inspirational. I think I did 'Antony and Cleopatra' and 'The Taming of the Shrew'. I lived in Ocean Beach, and my rent was $140 a month.","Daniel Lyons":"I wanted to write a book about what it's like to be 50 and trying to reinvent yourself - that struggle. There are all these books and inspirational speakers talking about being a lifelong learner, and it's so great to reinvent yourself, the brand of you.

He would always give you something from a movie, and you'd go, what did you just play... immediately inspirational writings, amazing. That's what we're going to miss.","Rosie O'Donnell":"I think that the reason for my success is that I am really not aspirational. I am inspirational in that the people at home feel like they can really relate to me.","Taylor Kinney":"I look up to a strong woman; maybe that's why I fell for Gaga. She works incredibly hard and is very strong and inspirational like Mom, with a great work ethic.","Lee Ritenour":"I've done a lot of albums and I kinda know when I'm onto something that was inspirational for me to record and create, and this was one of those projects where I really enjoyed making the album.","Ashthon Jones":"I love inspirational R&B, like Mary J.

But the last thing you want for it is to become too trendy and confusing. It has too much history.","Prince Royce":"When I was working at the Sprint store, I got laid off. I was bummed out, but I stayed positive. I used the money I had earned while working there to make my first album. Without that job, maybe 'Corazon Sin Cara' would never had been made. It's a very inspirational story.","Ellen Stofan":"You see countries like India really investing in their space program because they see it as inspirational and good for their economy.","Max Martin":"It's music.

And as an art form, they can be wonderfully entertaining and often inspirational.","Carly Schroeder":"I think that's a great opportunity, to pick a script where you can build up a good skill. I think the main thing I look for when I look at scripts is if it's inspirational. If it's something that teenagers can relate to. And is it something that the audience is going to get something out of. If not, then it's really not worth doing.","Robert Quillen":"There are glimpses of heaven to us in every act, or thought, or word, that raises us above ourselves.","Henry Norris Russell":"Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove.

You just gotta listen to the words and get what you can get out of it.","Russell Baker":"Roosevelt's declaration that Americans had 'nothing to fear but fear itself' was a glorious piece of inspirational rhetoric and just as gloriously wrong.","Adnan Sami":"Northeastern folk music influenced me from a very young age.

So, I am aware of the beauty of northeast folk music.","Angie Stone":"'Do What You Gotta Do' is a positive, inspirational song that says no matter what it is; whether you're up against challenges or trying to get your dreams and aspirations met, you should do what whatever you have to do shy of killing yourself or someone else.","Ashley Graham":"I think women think I'm inspirational because I'm unapologetic. I have cellulite. I have back fat. I've got a thick stomach. But I work my body like I don't because I don't know any other body. I don't know how to feel thin. I just know how to feel like Ashley.","Jameela Jamil":"We're in a situation where talented, motivated school leavers and graduates can send off a hundred CVs and not get a reply, and where a trip to the Job Centre is depressing rather than inspirational.

It doesn't reward the soul.","Rose Leslie":"It is so inspirational, to see that in the world of Westeros, men are answering to women, and they are a force to be reckoned with. It's empowering, and it's inspirational as well, because you're just like, 'This is great!'","Matthew Williamson":"I am shocked and deeply saddened by McQueen's death. He was a genius, and his talent was second to none. Like many others, I always cited him as a hugely inspirational leader of world fashion. He will be greatly missed.","Reggie Watts":"I think the end goal, hopefully, is to take advantage of the attention I've gotten along the way and use it for good and build some communities, and as I get older I can continue to do things and be surrounded by things that are inspirational to me.","Linda Johnson Rice":"'Ebony' is very inspirational and aspirational to its readers.","Adriana Trigiani":"You never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea.

It's a very inspirational song.","Neil Sedaka":"The hymn 'Amazing Grace' is so inspirational - I wish I'd written it.","Roma Downey":"This CD became something of a personal journey for me.

Wolper":"My initial goal for the 1984 opening ceremonies was a show that would be majestic, inspirational, and emotional - a 20 goosebump experience.","Joe Klein":"Barack Obama's inspirational whoosh to the presidency in 2008 was unusual. Most campaigns are less exhilarating; indeed, they are downright disappointing - until someone wins.","Rodney Atkins":"Every song you're trying to find something that going to connect in different ways but for me the songs that I'm really drawn to are inspirational, songs that lift you and that everybody can relate to no matter where you're from.","Malachi Kirby":"Kunta Kinte is the closest thing I've ever seen... to a superhero.

If anything inspirational happens, I have it there so nothing's forgotten.","Carol Ann Duffy":"I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it. But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.","James Iha":"I love a lot of the New York bands, but Patti Smith stands out.

Blair":"The leaders who we admire who have been able to bring great change in the past - Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela - they're all inspirational religious leaders and smart tacticians. It would be nice to find the Muslim Gandhi, wouldn't it?","Steve Garvey":"We all obviously need others to look up to, and be inspirational to us. Ford did a great job as far as putting the presidency back where it belonged, getting the trust back after Nixon. And President Reagan has been one of the most influential presidents.","Conor Maynard":"I would probably work with Drake as he is massively inspirational to me as a writer as well as an artist.

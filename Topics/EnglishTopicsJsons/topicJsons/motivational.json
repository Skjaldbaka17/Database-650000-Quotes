My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.","Herman Cain":"One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker.

I want it to go beyond the ring. I would love to be a motivational speaker.","Diane Sawyer":"Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too. Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it.","Edward Norton":"I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy.

Martinez":"I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life.","Louise Mensch":"I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don't accept your limitations, jump before you're pushed, leap before you look.","Anupam Kher":"I started doing motivational tours. I've seen all kinds of people, from the CEOs to the lowest executive, opening up to their fears.

Uchtdorf":"We need to accept that the commandments of God aren't just a long list of good ideas. They aren't 'life hacks' from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board.","Tiffany Trump":"I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure. He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.","Amy Waldman":"Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers.","Dominique Dawes":"I realized I love motivating and I love empowering and I love inspiring people. I did that as an athlete for 18 years, and I am able to do that as a motivational speaker now as well as doing work on television.","Emanuel Steward":"I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure.","Robert Louis Stevenson":"To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life.","Tina Brown":"Give Obama a script he has made his own, and he is the motivational speaker to end all speakers. Tony Robbins cloned with Honest Abe.","Martina Navratilova":"I've a great family, two children to take care of. Then, of course, I do commentary for TV.

But eventually, yes, I would like to pass on the knowledge and something that I would like to do.","Keke Palmer":"Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are.","Ryan Howard":"I was perceived to be a first- to third-rounder. I kind of had a tough junior year and fell to the fifth round. At that time, it was motivational."}

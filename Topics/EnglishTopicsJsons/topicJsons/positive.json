I love being able to wake up and do positive things, to go to the gym.","Hayley Hasselhoff":"I live my life with positivity, so even if there was a low, I'd find a positive in the situation.

This is not positive thinking - it is positive action: the spirit of experiment.","Vladimir Putin":"I have a very positive attitude to anyone who is protecting the environment, but it's inadmissible when people are using it as a means of promoting themselves, using it as a source of self-enrichment. I don't want to name any specific examples... but often, environmentalism is used to blackmail companies.","Sonam Kapoor":"Women of worth are those who want positive change for themselves, their families, community or society, which I think is important.

I'm learning things like that which help me be a better parent.","Dionne Warwick":"Healthy children are born from healthy, respected, well-nourished and educated mothers and it is imperative that they have a voice in the decisions which affect them. If you empower a mother and let her have her say towards a poverty-free future, the positive impact this would have on ending hunger will be immense.","Thandie Newton":"I'm always angry. I wake up angry. There is a lot to be angry about. Anger is a positive energy.","Jiddu Krishnamurti":"When the mind is empty, silent, when it is in a state of complete negation - which is not blankness, nor the opposite of being positive, but a totally different state in which all thought has ceased - only then is it possible for that which is unnameable to come into being.","Henrikh Mkhitaryan":"Everything comes from your mind. You have to push yourself to get things going in your direction. If you are stubborn, nothing will help. If you are sad, nothing will help. You have to keep positive and to work very well for your next chance.","Wilma Rudolph":"No one has a life where everything that happened was good.

I also have positive thinking.

This is the hub of America.","Bobby Knight":"My dad was a very quiet person, and unbelievably tough. But my grandmother gave me my first look at negative thinking to bring about positive results.

I definitely want to project a positive energy out into the world.","Gray Scott":"In 'Chappie,' you see this sort of young robot that's learning through maybe 'deep learning' how to see the world really, look out into the world, and learn step by step.

That's how powerful music can be.","Inga Muscio":"Love is a positive, symbiotic, reciprocal flow between two or more entities.","Eminem":"A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself.

I'm here to be positive.","Sriti Jha":"We breathe life into a role, and it's overwhelming to receive positive feedback.","Keanu Reeves":"Oftentimes, when we think of 3D, we think of things coming out of the screen, but actually, you've got this zero, this negative space, what they call the negative space, which is the scene, what's being filmed in the positive space of the audience.

Because the way to promote positive change and better human rights in Cuba is through engagement, not isolation.","Debbie Ford":"To transcend limitations and form positive new patterns of life based on who you know you can be rather than who you were yesterday, you must give up the modes of thinking, feeling and behaving that only keep you chained to your past.","Bonnie Blair":"What I've learned from my own journey, and from my family's experience with cancer, is how important it is to stay positive and move forward. Not every day is going to be perfect; that's life. But staying positive is going to get you to the next day.","Anthony Joshua":"Religion is supposed to be a positive thing when you look at the true religions around the world, not the fundamentalists.

Just to make sure that you are blending all these opinions in your mind before a decision is made.","Jose Saramago":"I presume that nobody will deny the positive aspects of the North American cultural world.

One of the great things about me is that I have a very positive attitude.","Melanne Verveer":"I believe to be a leader is to enable others to embrace a vision, initiative or assignment in a way that they feel a sense of purpose, ownership, personal engagement, and common cause. I was very affected as a child by my father's positive example as a civic leader who inspired others to share his commitment to improving our community.","Shepard Fairey":"Propaganda has a negative connotation, which it partially deserves, but I think there is some propaganda that is very positive. I feel that if you can do something that gets people's attention, then maybe they'll go and find out more about the person.","Willard Scott":"Positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality, and physical characteristics, warts and all; and, from belonging to a family that accepts you without question.","Elizabeth Edwards":"A positive attitude is not going to save you.

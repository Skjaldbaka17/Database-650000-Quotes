We need self-respect, identity, community, love, variety, beauty, challenge and a purpose in living that is greater than material accumulation.","Jewell Parker Rhodes":"Prejudice is sinful.

She said, 'No.' And I said, 'Oh yeah? Then how does he eat?' Liar.","Ariana Grande":"Love is a really scary thing, and you never know what's going to happen.

Love people, but put your full trust only in God.","Nicholas Sparks":"My wife, my family, my friends - they've all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means.

Chesterton":"The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost.","Loretta Young":"Love isn't something you find. Love is something that finds you.","Beyonce Knowles":"When you love and accept yourself, when you know who really cares about you, and when you learn from your mistakes, then you stop caring about what people who don't know you think.","Alain de Botton":"The thing is that love gives us a ringside seat on somebody else's flaws, so of course you're gonna spot some things that kinda need to be mentioned. But often the romantic view is to say, 'If you loved me, you wouldn't criticise me.' Actually, true love is often about trying to teach someone how to be the best version of themselves.","Lou Holtz":"Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they're making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that's the difference.","Swami Sivananda":"Your duty is to treat everybody with love as a manifestation of the Lord.","Keanu Reeves":"Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.","Plato":"Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods.","Zach Anner":"I've accepted that we've all got crap to deal with and problems that we're fighting not to be defined by.

The most important thing is that we appreciate the crazy ride we're on.","Dwayne Johnson":"If I love you, I show you I love you every day. Little things, big things.","Pope John Paul II":"You will reciprocally promise love, loyalty and matrimonial honesty.

That they infected me with their intelligence and energy for life, with their thirst for knowledge and their love. I'm grateful that I know where I come from.","Katherine Waterston":"I think connecting to a character is like connecting to any human being - either you like them or you don't. You might not be able to list the reasons why you love your best friend or what attracted you to them; it's just something that you feel - a connection, an understanding, or a curiosity that makes you want to get to know them.","Grace Gealey":"We may not know what each day has in store for us. We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now. It takes way more effort to shell out hate then it does to allow love to flow freely in our lives. After all, it's what we were born to do.","Paul Hollywood":"I love the sensation of being out in the open air, far away from all the distractions of modern life.

I love having a good time, and I enjoy being able to share those good times with others.","Naveen Jain":"Being a father has been, without a doubt, my greatest source of achievement, pride and inspiration. Fatherhood has taught me about unconditional love, reinforced the importance of giving back and taught me how to be a better person.","Allan Hamilton":"I call horses 'divine mirrors' - they reflect back the emotions you put in.

And the fear of it.","Joel Madden":"My mom always said that there would be haters. Not everyone can love ya.","Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec":"The body of a beautiful woman is not made for love; it is too exquisite.","Thomas Aquinas":"Love takes up where knowledge leaves off.","Bipasha Basu":"Any relationship should have love, and if there is no love, it is better to call off a relationship. People say that love happens only once, but I don't believe in it because for me, if one relationship doesn't work, you should move on and seek love in another relationship. Who knows; you might find love in the second relationship.","Suzanne Brockmann":"Dare, dream, dance, smile, and sing loudly! And have faith that love is an unstoppable force!","Adrianne Palicki":"I love shopping; I'm a jeans and a T-shirt kind of girl, but I go classy when I dress up - with a little bit of sexy.","Kim Elizabeth":"My imagination completely controls me, and forever feeds the fire that burns with dark red light in my heart by bringing me the best dreams.

After that you take the girl's clothes off.","Nikola Tesla":"I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.","Natalie Portman":"I don't love studying. I hate studying. I like learning. Learning is beautiful.","Ellen Key":"Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.","Jiddu Krishnamurti":"The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed.","Kim Jong-un":"Patriotism is not an abstract concept. It begins from one's own home. It buds out from the love for one's parents, spouses and children, the love for one's own home, village and workplace, and further develops into the love for one's country and fellow people.","Charles Kuralt":"The love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege.","Douglas Adams":"I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.","Jillian Rose Reed":"I love to be outdoors, so I like to hike, bike and go to the beach.","Jacqueline Leo":"One look at an email can rob you of 15 minutes of focus.

And what your potential is!","Megan Fox":"I love the beach, and I love sunshine.","Eden Ahbez":"Some white people hate black people, and some white people love black people, some black people hate white people, and some black people love white people. So you see it's not an issue of black and white, it's an issue of Lovers and Haters.","John Galsworthy":"Love has no age, no limit; and no death.","Reid Scott":"My personal style falls between casual cool and meticulous slob. I'm most comfortable in jeans, but I love fashion.","Marla Gibbs":"In my life I've learned that true happiness comes from giving. Helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are.

Every one has a dream to get a perfect life partner. But this is not so easy in real life. In fact, one doesn't love; it happens.","Zendaya":"Let's practice motivation and love, not discrimination and hate.","Gene Simmons":"I'm fascinated with myself and love hearing the sound of my own voice. I'd like to hear what I have to say. A lot of people don't like being alone because they truly don't like themselves, but I love me.","NeNe Leakes":"I'm just not into trying to convince people like me. I always say to myself, 'It is what it is.' I walk into a situation knowing that people are either going to love me or they're not, and that's OK. I'm just going to be me. You can't be everything to everyone.","Julia Roberts":"True love doesn't come to you it has to be inside you.","Kathie Lee Gifford":"Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day.","Queen Elizabeth II":"Grief is the price we pay for love.","Juan Pablo Galavis":"In life, you have to take the pace that love goes. You don't force it. You just don't force love, you don't force falling in love, you don't force being in love - you just become. I don't know how to say that in English, but you just feel it.","John Gay":"Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow thee.","Pierre Corneille":"Self-love is the source of all our other loves.","Elie Wiesel":"That I survived the Holocaust and went on to love beautiful girls, to talk, to write, to have toast and tea and live my life - that is what is abnormal.","Vincent Van Gogh":"The way to know life is to love many things.","Caroline Knapp":"Fall in love with a dog, and in many ways you enter a new orbit, a universe that features not just new colors but new rituals, new rules, a new way of experiencing attachment.","Boris Pasternak":"Love is not weakness. It is strong. Only the sacrament of marriage can contain it.","Kate Forsyth":"I love fairy tales because of their haunting beauty and magical strangeness. They are set in worlds where anything can happen. Frogs can be kings, a thicket of brambles can hide a castle where a royal court has lain asleep for a hundred years, a boy can outwit a giant, and a girl can break a curse with nothing but her courage and steadfastness.","Emily Dickinson":"Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality.","Joyce Banda":"I learned that leadership is about falling in love with the people and the people falling in love with you. It is about serving the people with selflessness, with sacrifice, and with the need to put the common good ahead of personal interests.","Henri Frederic Amiel":"Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind.","Ginger Rogers":"My love for ice cream emerged at an early age - and has never left!","Michael Jackson":"Let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul, and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation.","Sophia Loren":"There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age.","Theodore Isaac Rubin":"I must learn to love the fool in me - the one who feels too much, talks too much, takes too many chances, wins sometimes and loses often, lacks self-control, loves and hates, hurts and gets hurt, promises and breaks promises, laughs and cries.","P. J. O'Rourke":"Anyway, no drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we're looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.","Margaret D. Nadauld":"A woman of faith is blessed by faithful men in her life who hold the priesthood of God and honor this privilege: her father, bishop, husband, brothers, sons. They value her and the divine gifts given by God to His daughter. They sustain and encourage, and they understand the great mission of her life as a woman. They love her; they bless her.","Virginia Woolf":"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.","Michel Houellebecq":"The love of a dog is a pure thing.

I love to offer flowers, too!","Miguel de Unamuno":"Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion.","John Ruskin":"When love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece.","Pope Francis":"A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: 'Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?' We must always consider the person.","Kirk Cameron":"It is my goal to love everyone. I hate no one. Regardless of their race, religion, their proclivities, the desire of their heart and how they want to live their life and the decisions that they make. I can even respect people's decisions and lifestyle choices just as I hope they have the courtesy to respect my decisions and my choices.","Rich Sommer":"Gaming has been a great way to get to know people. That's part of what I love about games, that they are social.","Kim Kardashian":"I love when people underestimate me and then become pleasantly surprised.","Carl Sagan":"For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.","Sarah Gadon":"In the summer, I love to go up north to a cottage and relax by the lake, swim, go canoeing... I also love riding my bike around Toronto, going to the farmer's market, cooking. That sounds simple, but it's a luxury you don't have when you're living in hotels.","Jason Statham":"I love getting dressed up in a suit because I don't do it all the time.","Emma Roberts":"I love dressing up. It's the best part of being a girl, I think.","Ashton Irwin":"I can't really explain what it's like to be in love, but I feel like it's being comfortable. It's almost like having a best friend. It's a beautiful thing.","Sonia Rykiel":"Knowing yourself, and learning to love yourself as you are, is the beginning of beauty. I think the most important thing is to show off what's most beautiful about you and to hide what's less beautiful.","Ross Mathews":"Love yourself, whatever makes you different, and use it to make you stand out. Mine is my voice and the fact that I'm gay: well, the fact that I'm flamboyantly gay.","William Arthur Ward":"Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you.","Christian Nestell Bovee":"Our first and last love is self-love.","Delilah":"A lot of times, in our culture and our society, we put romantic love somehow on a higher plane than self-love and friendship love. You can't do that. You have to honor and really fully invest in all these different loving relationships.","Charles Morgan":"There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved: It is God's finger on man's shoulder.","Emma Watson":"It sounds like a cliche but I also learnt that you're not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are.","Alfred A. Montapert":"Animals are reliable, many full of love, true in their affections, predictable in their actions, grateful and loyal.

He's just the coolest dude on Earth.","Elizabeth I":"I do not want a husband who honours me as a queen, if he does not love me as a woman.","Sam Harris":"Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness. We form friendships so that we can feel certain emotions, like love, and avoid others, like loneliness. We eat specific foods to enjoy their fleeting presence on our tongues. We read for the pleasure of thinking another person's thoughts.","David Chang":"Food, to me, is always about cooking and eating with those you love and care for.","Ciara":"My son has been the best thing that has happened in my life. He has been amazing, and he is truly heaven-sent.

It takes hard work, love, luck, and a lot of energy, and it is the most rewarding experience that you can ever have.","Norman Maclean":"At sunrise everything is luminous but not clear. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us. You can love completely without complete understanding.","D. H. Lawrence":"You don't want to love - your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved. You aren't positive, you're negative. You absorb, absorb, as if you must fill yourself up with love, because you've got a shortage somewhere.","Angie Stone":"Allowing myself to love God completely has obviously shed light on my self-love because he loves me more than I could ever love myself.","James Altucher":"Your competition is not other people but the time you kill, the ill will you create, the knowledge you neglect to learn, the connections you fail to build, the health you sacrifice along the path, your inability to generate ideas, the people around you who don't support and love your efforts, and whatever god you curse for your bad luck.","Jean Cocteau":"I love cats because I enjoy my home; and little by little, they become its visible soul.","Gilbert Parker":"Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars.","Christie Brinkley":"I believe in true love, and I believe in happy endings.

I think it's such a passionate color. Every flag of every country pretty much has red it it. It's power, there's no fence sitting with red. Either you love it or you don't. I think its blood and strength and life. I do love red. I love all colors. Great shades of blue, you find them in nature. They're all magic.","Arthur Schopenhauer":"A man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free.","Dorothea Dix":"The rose is the flower and handmaiden of love - the lily, her fair associate, is the emblem of beauty and purity.","Gina Barreca":"Like love, breakfast is best when made at home.","Wynter Gordon":"What I love about Sade other than her smooth and sultry voice is her willingness to be vulnerable. As a powerful, strong and beautiful woman of color, she showed her delicate, passionate side in a world where most of us are putting on a brave face. I love how effortless her style was and how consistent that red lip was!","Katy Perry":"I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease. I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards. But I like to get people thinking. That's what the stories in my music do.","Edgar Allan Poe":"We loved with a love that was more than love.","Ariel Levy":"A wedding, a great wedding, is just a blast.

There's so much to learn and see all the time, and nothing nicer for me than to wake up, and the sky is blue.","Cheryl Cole":"I believe in soulmates, yes, but I believe you also have to work at love. I happen to believe your soulmate doesn't have to be your partner - your soulmate could be your best friend, your sibling, it doesn't have to be the person you marry.","Elon Musk":"There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing.","Ricky Martin":"You just have to get rid of fear and confront the world.

Don't listen to other people.","Antoine de Saint-Exupery":"Tell me who admires and loves you, and I will tell you who you are.","Charles Dickens":"A loving heart is the truest wisdom.","Celine Dion":"Some people can't stand being alone. I love solitude and silence. But when I come out of it, I'm a regular talking machine. It's all or nothing for me.","Ralph Baer":"People love video games because they do things they obviously can't do in real life.

I can't imagine becoming bored with red - it would be like becoming bored with the person you love.","Marc Jacobs":"I don't love Photoshop; I like imperfection. It doesn't mean ugly.

The day-to-day sketching is fraught.","Arundhati Roy":"I think the kind of landscape that you grew up in, it lives with you. I don't think it's true of people who've grown up in cities so much; you may love a building, but I don't think that you can love it in the way that you love a tree or a river or the colour of the earth; it's a different kind of love.","Bristol Palin":"I love my son more than anything.

If I'm gonna have any looks at all, I'm gonna have to create them.","Baruch Spinoza":"I would warn you that I do not attribute to nature either beauty or deformity, order or confusion.

When you discover them, you become happy.","Celine Dion":"There's no such thing is aging, but maturing and knowledge. It's beautiful, I call that beauty.","Henry David Thoreau":"The perception of beauty is a moral test.","Devon Aoki":"Everyone has their own insecurities, regardless of how you look or how people perceive you, but sometimes people give their insecurities too much power.

G. Wells":"Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.","Lorraine Hansberry":"I am a writer.

I love a woman with a beautiful smile.","Ayaan Hirsi Ali":"I'd love to go and visit the Mosque in Mecca again, just for the sheer beauty of it, not for God - much the way a non-Catholic might go to Vatican City because of the beauty of the buildings and the artifacts.","Marisol Nichols":"Growing up, I just wanted to be like everyone else. I didn't value or understand the beauty in being different at the time in my life.","Aaron Rodgers":"The beauty of our country is that when it was founded that they took some time to lay out civil liberties in the first 10 Amendments - the Bill of Rights.

Everyone should find his own balance in his personal as well as his professional life. Once you do so, you will feel and look beautiful.","Liu Wen":"People probably think I'm cute because I have dimples and am friendly and always smiling. But beauty is different.

I try to get at least 8 hours of sleep, drinking a lot of water and exercising.","Aristotle":"Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference.","Karl Lagerfeld":"Beauty is also submitted to the taste of time, so a beautiful woman from the Belle Epoch is not exactly the perfect beauty of today, so beauty is something that changes with time.","Brin-Jonathan Butler":"Both for Havana's beauty and decay, it's very hard to restrain yourself from staring everywhere you look.","Ron Ben-Israel":"Pastry is different from cooking because you have to consider the chemistry, beauty and flavor. It's not just sugar and eggs thrown together. I tell my pastry chefs to be in tune for all of this. You have to be challenged by using secret or unusual ingredients.","Jada Pinkett Smith":"Art should never be limited - the beauty of art is that it gives us the freedom to go places where we wouldn't go to in our normal lives. Inside, I'm just so many different people. I go from the pretty girl on the red carpet to the singer at Ozzfest, spitting in the crowd. That's Jada.","Caroline Winberg":"You can always enhance your natural beauty; you learn what works for your face because crazy make-up doesn't really suit anyone.","Stewart Udall":"Cherish sunsets, wild creatures and wild places. Have a love affair with the wonder and beauty of the earth.","Hugh Laurie":"Riding my motorcycle around L.A. is like my own video game.

I would rather be a giraffe so that I could contemplate the beauty of Africa.","Eliza Farnham":"The human face is the organic seat of beauty.

Beauty halts and freezes the melting flux of nature.","Toni Servillo":"I think that beauty can injure you to death. It can cause an injury that can never be cured.

Rather, it's an asset to be used judiciously and with an understanding of how it is just a small part of who you are.","Pablo Picasso":"Art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon.

I use only The Body Shop products on my face, as they use the least amount of chemicals.","Tony Kushner":"Who knows better than artists how much ugliness there is on the way to beauty, how many ghastly, mortifying missteps, how many days of granitic blockheadedness and dismaying ineptitude there is on the way to accomplishment, how partial all accomplishment is, how incomplete?","James Beattie":"And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.","Paulo Coelho":"Beauty is the greatest seducer of man.","Christian Louboutin":"My father, who was a cabinetmaker, told me, 'Wood has a grain and if you go into the grain, you have beauty. If you go against it, you have splinters - it breaks.' And I took that as my view of life. You have to follow the grain - to be sensitive to the direction of life.","John McAfee":"I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person, and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes.

That's what home should be. That you have a sense of warmth, security, love, and you love the things around you and surround yourself with beauty.","Joanne Woodward":"Sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades, but to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day, ah, now that's a real treat.","Ori Gersht":"Violence can be very grotesque and also intensely attractive. What interests me is how the two - beauty and violence - live side by side, and how moments can be created and erased almost simultaneously. Destruction is painful, but at times it can be very cathartic.","Michael Shnayerson":"In the hierarchy of public lands, national parks by law have been above the rest: America's most special places, where natural beauty and all its attendant pleasures - quiet waters, the scents of fir and balsam, the hoot of an owl, and the dark of a night sky unsullied by city lights - are sacrosanct.","Diogo Morgado":"Laughter and joy are part of the beauty of life.","Albert Camus":"The artist forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from.

She is a visitor who leaves behind the gift of grief, the souvenir of pain.","William C. Bryant":"A sculptor wields The chisel, and the stricken marble grows To beauty.","Katha Pollitt":"Ariel may look a lot like Barbie, and her adventure may be limited to romance and over with the wedding bells, but unlike, say, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, she's active, brave and determined, the heroine of her own life. She even rescues the prince. And that makes her a rare fish, indeed, in the world of preschool culture.","Hans Urs von Balthasar":"Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.","Liz Cheney":"In Wyoming, the beauty of our mountains is matched only by the grit of our people.","Constantin Stanislavski":"Do not try to push your way through to the front ranks of your profession; do not run after distinctions and rewards; but do your utmost to find an entry into the world of beauty.","Tom Brokaw":"While Pickstown may not be what it once was, it still is framed by the natural beauty of the ancient river, the sweep of the Great Plains, and the long, unbroken shoreline of the lake behind the dam. It gave me a 19th-century childhood in a modern mid-20th-century town, and for that I will always be grateful.","Jonathan Sacks":"Part of the beauty of Judaism, and surely this is so for other faiths also, is that it gently restores control over time.

Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside.","Katie Ledecky":"I think the beauty of Catholicism is its consistency through both successes and difficulties. I've counted on my faith to give me strength through both training and competition - but also in school, with my family and everyday life.","George Herbert Mead":"The beauty of a face is not a separate quality but a relation or proportion of qualities to each other.","Patrick Demarchelier":"Beauty is in the character of a person.

Anyone can take a good picture.","Roy Barnes":"We live in a state with a wonderful climate and plenty of natural beauty, from the shores of Cumberland Island to the Chattahoochee River to the Blue Ridge Mountains.","Emil Ferris":"Monsters are a departure from 'reality' in a way that allows for a range of fantastic possibilities. I mean this within the world of literature as well as in regards to art. When I sit down to draw, I'm energized by the possibility of creating a monster. That is where I find beauty and pathos.","Bela Karolyi":"Genetics is all about showcasing human beauty along with high-quality performance.","Theophile Gautier":"Art is beauty, the perpetual invention of detail, the choice of words, the exquisite care of execution.","Samuel Ullman":"In the central place of every heart, there is a recording chamber; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer and courage, you are young.","Ana Tijoux":"I think we live in a world where the most important thing is daily life: sharing a space with your family, making meals, being with your people. It's not only the idea of privacy, it's the beauty of the moment, at a time in the world when everything goes really fast - too fast.","Charlie Chaplin":"I do not have much patience with a thing of beauty that must be explained to be understood.

It is to look for love, truth, virtue, and beauty.","Scott Derrickson":"The role that blood plays in Christian iconography is huge - the washing of the blood, the shedding of blood, the blood of the cross, the crucifixion, the violence of that imagery. These are horrific, and yet they are at the center of the Christian faith. There is a place where beauty and terror merge, and it's at the cross.","Agnes Martin":"When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.","Pier Luigi Loro Piana":"Sailing is in the same vein as horse riding. There's a beauty to it; it's an elegant sport.

In things that are not seen at once, and have no respect one to another, great variety is commendable, provided this variety transgress not the rules of optics and geometry.","Johnny Depp":"The beauty, the poetry of the fear in their eyes. I didn't mind going to jail for, what, five, six hours? It was absolutely worth it.","Loretta Young":"There is no personal achievement in being born beautiful.","Robert Green Ingersoll":"Beauty is not all there is of poetry. It must contain the truth.

It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.","Sharon Tate":"My definition of love is being full. Complete. It makes everything lighter. Beauty is something you see. Love is something you feel.","Kelsey Grammer":"All of the great music ever written is based upon the Mass. I mean, it's pretty extraordinary stuff, and I think it's done the world some good. And if you take a look at some of the mosques in the world, it calls you to worship the kind of beauty that's in there.","Martina McBride":"I think we should all be tolerant of each other and embrace each others' strengths and differences and uniqueness and beauty.","Justin Cronin":"My theory of characterization is basically this: Put some dirt on a hero, and put some sunshine on the villain, one brush stroke of beauty on the villain.","Arne Jacobsen":"Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty.

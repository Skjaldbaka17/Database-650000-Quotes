Just like everyone else.","Winston Churchill":"I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly.","Jim Carrey":"I got a lot of support from my parents.

I have written one or two novels which are not specifically funny. I wrote a study of Shakespeare which was not intended to be funny, but some people regard it as such.","Benjamin Franklin":"Wine is constant proof that God loves us and loves to see us happy.","Peter Ustinov":"Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.","Hedy Lamarr":"Any girl can be glamorous.

If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.","Groucho Marx":"A child of five would understand this. Send someone to fetch a child of five.","Eminem":"You know, fame is a funny thing, man, especially, you know, actors, musicians, rappers, rock singers, it's kind of a lifestyle and it's easy to get caught up in it - you go to bars, you go to clubs, everyone's doing a certain thing... It's tough.","Don Marquis":"A pessimist is a person who has had to listen to too many optimists.","Mort Sahl":"My life needs editing.","Ellen DeGeneres":"I think they should have a Barbie with a buzz cut.","Theodore Roosevelt":"If you could kick the person in the pants responsible for most of your trouble, you wouldn't sit for a month.","Karan Patel":"I am blessed with a funny gene that makes me enjoy life.","Clint Eastwood":"If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.","Douglas Adams":"I'm spending a year dead for tax reasons.","Warren Buffett":"I buy expensive suits. They just look cheap on me.","Johnny Depp":"I detest jokes - when somebody tells me one, I feel my IQ dropping; the brain cells start to disappear.

They're the same people restoring the Statue of Liberty.","John Krasinski":"You can't do anything to be funny. That's cringeworthy. If your humor comes out of a place of love every time, you don't make the joke bigger than you. The funniest comedians are in touch with their emotional level.","Lucille Ball":"You see much more of your children once they leave home.","Milton Berle":"Now a 'funnyman' can get a laugh before opening his mouth - looking funny. Lou Costello was one of your great funnymen. Harry Langdon, Larry Semon; they were all funnymen - they looked funny. W.C. Fields was never a comedian. Slim Summerville was a comedian, yet looked funny. Now if you have both attributes, you are in good shape.","Bertrand Russell":"I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.","Kailash Kher":"I don't follow anything blindly. I have to know the entire thing, if I have to get in to it. It might sound funny to you, but it's like using English language.

My mind is going a million miles an hour, trying to remember my act, trying to say it all the right way. It's funny how different it looks and how it's happening. There are three Fellini circuses in my head, and outwardly it looks like I'm going to get a bagel.","Charles M. Schulz":"I love mankind; it's people I can't stand.","Kaskade":"I have really fond memories of growing up in Chicago, and I always love going back.

There are so many ways to use them.","Alex Haley":"Anytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help.","Ben Stein":"Screaming at children over their grades, especially to the point of the child's tears, is child abuse, pure and simple.

Funny things happen to me in the course of a day, and I just make notes.","George Bernard Shaw":"Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.","Keke Palmer":"I went to private school for a very long time, and we always wore uniforms. Then in third grade, I switched to a public school, so I was so excited to wear what I wanted on the first day. I remember I chose this orange hoodie with a skirt, and it's so funny when I think about it now because my style really hasn't changed that much.","Nora Dunn":"I never thought I was funny, but I enjoy being funny.","Millie Bobby Brown":"I love Adele. Adele is my favorite artist. She's British. She's funny. She's just an amazing, incredible voice, and I love to sing as well.","Sheena Easton":"We are supposed to enjoy the good stuff now, while we can, with the people we love. Life has a funny way of teaching us that lesson over and over again.","Margot Robbie":"There's nothing I dislike more than being in a photo shoot where they say, 'Be yourself.' That's not why I became an actress. That's what I find so funny: that you become an actor, and all of a sudden, everyone wants to know about you. But I didn't become an actor so I could show you me.","Franklin P. Jones":"One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening.","Kurt Fuller":"I grew up as a very sarcastic person. I was always the class clown, and to date girls, I had to be really funny. I was really skinny growing up. I was so thin, I had to run around in the shower to get wet. That kind of thin. So I always had to rely on humor and sarcasm.","Adlai E. Stevenson":"It's hard to lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse.","Jimi Hendrix":"It's funny how most people love the dead, once you're dead, you're made for life.","Herbert Hoover":"All men are equal before fish.","H. G. Wells":"Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.","Jeff Garlin":"There's only one true superpower amongst human beings, and that is being funny.

Jerome":"What I am looking for is a blessing not in disguise.","Marlon Wayans":"If you could cross a lion and a monkey, that's what I'd be, because monkeys are funny and lions are strong.","Joe Rogan":"It's painful for me to watch someone who isn't funny. It's horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks.","P. J. O'Rourke":"Being a humorist is not a voluntary thing. You can tell this because in a situation where saying a funny thing will cause a lot of trouble, a humorist will still say the funny thing. No matter how inappropriate.","Buddy Hackett":"As a child my family's menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it.","Charles Darwin":"I love fools' experiments. I am always making them.","Saul Bellow":"When we ask for advice, we are usually looking for an accomplice.","W. Somerset Maugham":"It's a funny thing about life; if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it.","Kate McKinnon":"Comedy is a tool of togetherness. It's a way of putting your arm around someone, pointing at something, and saying, 'Isn't it funny that we do that?' It's a way of reaching out.","Stephen King":"I guess when you turn off the main road, you have to be prepared to see some funny houses.","Judy Garland":"I wasn't close to my father, but I wanted to be all my life. He had a funny sense of humor, and he laughed all the time - good and loud, like I do. He was a gay Irish gentleman and very good-looking. And he wanted to be close to me, too, but we never had much time together.","Bill Burr":"I still remember the first gig where I got people going, it was Rascals in New Jersey, and the place was packed. I was scared. People were expecting me to be funny. I gotta be honest, every time I walk into a club, it's that same fear.","Billy Collins":"Humor, for me, is really a gate of departure. It's a way of enticing a reader into a poem so that less funny things can take place later. It really is not an end in itself, but a means to an end.","Robert A. Heinlein":"Yield to temptation. It may not pass your way again.","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu":"When you see things upside down, the ego can be extraordinarily funny; it's absurd. But it's tragic at the same time.","Richard Dawkins":"By all means let's be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out.","Kate Bosworth":"It's so different when you change your hair color, you're treated so differently. It's a very funny experience. It's fun - I love changing up my hair.","Woody Allen":"My one regret in life is that I am not someone else.","Ivan Reitman":"A good actor is someone who knows how to take the part and make it real and make it honest and be effective in it. If it's in a funny movie and, as long as they are cast in an appropriate way, humor will come from it.","Emma Watson":"Ignoring fame was my rebellion, in a funny way. I was insistent on being normal and doing normal things. It probably wasn't advisable to go to college in America and room with a complete stranger. And it probably wasn't wise to share a bathroom with eight other people in a coed dorm. Looking back, that was crazy.","Eldridge Cleaver":"Too much agreement kills a chat.","Michael Schumacher":"You win a race, the next race it's a question mark. Are you still the best or not? That's what is funny. But that's what is interesting. And that's what is challenging. You have to prove yourself every time.","Jonah Hill":"'Funny People' is my favorite performance of myself to date. Even though it's a comedy and there are serious moments, I really felt like Leo felt like a real person. It didn't feel like I was playing myself. Whether it's a comedy or drama, I just try to make it as realistic as possible.","Daniel Tosh":"It's funny... you can make fun of AIDS or Haiti, but if you make fun of some starlet in Hollywood's looks? That's like the one thing... the line you are not to cross.","Eddie Van Halen":"It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?","Flannery O'Connor":"I don't deserve any credit for turning the other cheek as my tongue is always in it.","Bernard Sahlins":"Actually being funny is mostly telling the truth about things.","Taika Waititi":"Maori get pigeonholed into the idea they're spiritual and telling stories like 'Whale Rider' and 'Once Were Warriors,' quite serious stuff, but we're pretty funny people, and we never really have had an opportunity to show that side of ourselves, the clumsy, nerdy side of ourselves, which is something I am.","Christina Aguilera":"So, where's the Cannes Film Festival being held this year?","Carrie Fisher":"If my life wasn't funny, it would just be true, and that's unacceptable.","Alice Roosevelt Longworth":"He looks as though he's been weaned on a pickle.","Lana Turner":"A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.","Pink":"I know my strong points: I work hard, I have talent, I'm funny, and I'm a good person.","Casey Stengel":"They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What's funny about that?","Dave Barry":"It is a scientific fact that your body will not absorb cholesterol if you take it from another person's plate.","Bill Watterson":"Reality continues to ruin my life.","Milos Forman":"Memories are doing funny things to us.","Paul Simon":"I was eating in a Chinese restaurant downtown. There was a dish called Mother and Child Reunion. It's chicken and eggs. And I said, I gotta use that one.","Jenna McCarthy":"I don't care how handsome or fabulous or funny the groom is, or how sweet and accommodating the bride, or vice versa. Marriage is hard.","Casper Smart":"Honestly, I like someone who is really grounded, super sweet, honest. I need them to have a sense of humor. I need them to laugh at what's funny, I need them to get jokes and be funny and be witty and sarcastic.","Molly O'Keefe":"It's funny what memory does, isn't it? My favorite holiday tradition might not have happened more than once or twice. But because it is such a good memory, so encapsulating of everything I love about the holidays, in my mind it happened every year. Without fail.","Jay London":"I saw a stationery store move.","Tommy Cooper":"I went window shopping today! I bought four windows.","Alan Alda":"It's a funny feeling to work with people who you consider your colleagues and to realize that they actually are young enough to be your children.","Herb Caen":"I have a memory like an elephant. I remember every elephant I've ever met.","P. G. Wodehouse":"Memories are like mulligatawny soup in a cheap restaurant. It is best not to stir them.","Hannah Murray":"Turns out you have a really fun time if you go to work every day and focus on being silly and funny and happy!","Rick Wakeman":"There's a fine line between angry and grumpy. Angry isn't nice, but grumpy is funny.","Nick Cannon":"Mariah is a beautiful and talented person, and I've had a crush on her for as long as I can remember. Every day, my respect for Mariah continues to grow higher. She's a caring, warm and funny person. People have no idea how funny she is! I feel like I've always known she was my forever love.","Yogi Berra":"I don't mean to be funny.","Bassem Youssef":"The importance of satire is bringing more people to the table. There are a lot of average citizens who aren't interested in politics and would be more interested if it's brought to them in a comedic, funny, satirical way.","Adam Scott":"I like having a beard. What's funny is when you shave a beard, you realize how freezing cold your face is! The primary purpose evolution-wise is to keep you warm, to grow hair on your face. You shave it off, and your face is freezing for a few days.","Norm MacDonald":"I'd say Jon Stewart has remained funny the entire time. Jon always makes it funny first. And he's just, he's talking about serious things, but in a funny way. Other comedians will talk about serious things in a serious way, and then you don't know what's going on.","Sam Shepard":"It's funny, in a way the actor is a writer. It's not like the two things are so separate as to be like apples and oranges. The writer and the actor are one.","Unknown":"I never drink water because of the disgusting things that fish do in it.","George Takei":"I discovered that funny animal pictures - memes - would get a lot of likes and shares.","Jason McCoy":"Porsche is a driver's car - a performance car. That was funny - here's this awesome car, but it's got no cup holders.","Phyllis Diller":"Best way to get rid of kitchen odors: Eat out.","Rita Rudner":"I was a vegetarian until I started leaning toward the sunlight.","Jean-Luc Godard":"To be or not to be. That's not really a question.","J. Cole":"I was just a goofy little funny kid, who was always getting sent to the principal. It wasn't serious because I was smart. I wasn't like a true troublemaker, just rambunctious - like, talkative and trying to be funny. That was me in middle-school.","Rob Zombie":"The funny thing is, I'm so used to not caring what anyone says, good or bad, that unfortunately even when people say good things... I wish it made me feel good, but it doesn't.","Robert Frost":"It's a funny thing that when a man hasn't anything on earth to worry about, he goes off and gets married.","Eddie Izzard":"I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing.","Steve Irwin":"You know, you can touch a stick of dynamite, but if you touch a venomous snake it'll turn around and bite you and kill you so fast it's not even funny.","Voltaire":"The superfluous, a very necessary thing.","Arthur C. Clarke":"The best measure of a man's honesty isn't his income tax return. It's the zero adjust on his bathroom scale.","Simon Sinek":"Leave America and you'll find that the consumers in many other countries enjoy watching advertising. Not because the products are better, but because the ads are produced to be entertaining. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are dramatic. Sometimes they are just beautiful.","Nick Jonas":"It sounds funny, but my biggest fear is that I'm not perfect. I'm a perfectionist, and I get upset when things go wrong or when I don't do well.","Frank Sinatra":"I'm for whatever gets you through the night.","Molly Ivins":"I've always found it easier to be funny than to be serious.","Brendon Urie":"The funny thing about the people I don't like - they're very self-centered.","Stevie Wonder":"Do you know, it's funny, but I never thought of being blind as a disadvantage, and I never thought of being black as a disadvantage.","Tim Allen":"Men are liars. We'll lie about lying if we have to. I'm an algebra liar. I figure two good lies make a positive.","Stephen Leacock":"It is to be observed that 'angling' is the name given to fishing by people who can't fish.","Wavy Gravy":"Keep your sense of humor, my friend; if you don't have a sense of humor it just isn't funny anymore.","Freddie Wong":"Gamer humor ranges all over the place. What it comes down to is taking a lot of what we see in gaming and we're familiar with in gaming and being like, 'OK, hold on, let's re-examine this for a second. Isn't this funny? Isn't this strange? Isn't this a little bit ridiculous?' That's where it is.","Rosie Perez":"In my circle of friends, I've always been loud and funny and talkative. But as soon as I step out of that circle, I get very quiet and introspective. I don't want the spotlight on me.","H. L. Mencken":"Marriage is a wonderful institution, but who would want to live in an institution?","Zora Neale Hurston":"It's a funny thing, the less people have to live for, the less nerve they have to risk losing nothing.","Raymond Chandler":"He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.","Johnny Carson":"If it weren't for Philo T. Farnsworth, inventor of television, we'd still be eating frozen radio dinners.","Chris Lilley":"I find teenage girls endlessly funny.","Keanu Reeves":"I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness.","Samuel Goldwyn":"Let's have some new cliches.","Elton John":"I love every minute of fatherhood, staying up all night, changing nappies, kids crying, I find it really funny and inspiring. It connects you to the world in a new way.","Sylvie Meis":"It's funny, the moment you dread the most, seeing yourself bald, is actually not such a bad moment at all.","Carol Burnett":"I'm really not that funny in real life! But I am the best audience one could find. I love to laugh.","Ice Cube":"It's funny how people who ain't never been down there can think that America is so fair and that we should be alright. It's funny that the people who have their foot on our neck are telling us, 'Get up. What's wrong with you?'","Kevin Whately":"You just suddenly think that there's something quite childish about acting. Basically, it's pretending, isn't it? It's good fun and I enjoy it, but it's a funny way of making a living, particularly when you make a very good wage, as I've been fortunate enough to do.","David Sedaris":"I love things made out of animals. It's just so funny to think of someone saying, 'I need a letter opener. I guess I'll have to kill a deer.","Kurt Vonnegut":"When I'm being funny, I try not to offend. I don't think much of what I've done has been in really ghastly taste. I don't think I have embarrassed many people or distressed them.","Mindy Kaling":"It used to be that you had to make female TV characters perfect so no one would be offended by your 'portrayal' of women. Even when I started out on 'The Office' eight years ago, we could write our male characters funny and flawed, but not the women. And now, thankfully, it's completely different.","Jacob deGrom":"You'll hear 'Hippie,' or, 'Get a haircut.' I like it. I think it's funny because they think we've never heard that before. So, like, good one.","Teddy Thompson":"I love the sad songs with their maudlin, self-deprecating, almost funny lyrics. As an Englishman, they make a lot of sense.","Taylor Hawkins":"Life is funny. If you don't laugh, you're in trouble.","Hunter S. Thompson":"A word to the wise is infuriating.","Lily Tomlin":"If love is the answer, could you please rephrase the question?","Spike Milligan":"How long was I in the army? Five foot eleven.","Tamsin Greig":"I am interested in shows that are not out-and-out gag fests: you see the truth of a broken heart behind them. That is what life is like: it's really funny, you see funny things as soon as you step out of the room, but underneath that is a whole bag of broken hearts. It's that real pain and that real hilarity that makes life so intriguing.","Bill Vaughan":"Money won't buy happiness, but it will pay the salaries of a large research staff to study the problem.","Tallulah Bankhead":"If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner.","Terry Pratchett":"The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.","Jack Benny":"I don't deserve this award, but I have arthritis and I don't deserve that either.","Paula Deen":"I don't care what the haters and naysayers say. If they make jokes about me, I'll laugh because they'll probably be funny.","Jean Giraudoux":"Only the mediocre are always at their best.","Fred Allen":"The last time I saw him he was walking down lover's lane holding his own hand.","Lil' Kim":"I like bowling. I suck at it, but I like it. You know what's so funny? I have days when I'm absolutely great at doing it, and then I have days when I just don't understand it.","Jeremy Lin":"It seems like everybody's perception of me is very bipolar. To one group, it's overpaid, overrated; to another group, it's underpaid, underrated, underdog. It's funny to me because there's no real balance.","Rhys Darby":"I love airports because funny things always happen at them. They're giant complexes full of urgency, seriousness, and confusion. Where am I supposed to be? Which way do I go? And that's just the staff.","Mason Cooley":"Cure for an obsession: get another one.","Ryan Reynolds":"It's funny, because there are so many stereotypes out there about actors and movie stars in general, but I've had a great opportunity to meet a lot of them, and maybe it's just because they don't behave that way around me, but I rarely see that kind of abuse of power.","Ed Sheeran":"Try to find someone with a sense of humor. That's an important thing to have because when you get into an argument, one of the best ways to diffuse it is to be funny. You don't want to hide away from a point, because some points are serious, but you'd rather have a discussion that was a discussion, rather than an argument.","Jimmy Fallon":"I'm on so late I'm definitely the last seconds of anyone's attention. So I just want to give them something dumb to laugh at, so they go, 'That's funny,' then fall asleep.","Ariana Grande":"I can't stress to you enough how much I can relate to teens being cyberbullied. Something that helps me is looking at old videos of me and my friends from middle school, or videos of my family. I love watching funny videos of my favorite people - it really cheers me up.","Psy":"I'm not that good looking. That's why 'Gangnam Style' works. If someone handsome uses that phrase it's just awkward. But if someone like me uses it, it's funny.","Malin Akerman":"The funny thing is that my husband couldn't be sweeter. He looks like this bad boy. He's got tattoos and earrings and a mohawk, but when you talk to him and he's around you, he's such a gentleman. He holds doors for ladies. He pulls out chairs. He cooks. He cleans.","George Harrison":"Although I have guitars all around, and I pick them up occasionally and write a tune and make a record, I don't really see myself as a musician. It may seem a funny thing to say. It's just like, I write lyrics, and I make up songs, but I'm not a great lyricist or songwriter or producer. It's when you put all these things together - that makes me.","Grimes":"It's obviously funny to be a meme, so I could be down with it in that regard, but it also belittles one's art.","Nicole Holofcener":"Filming is a funny combination of having a good time and not being able to wait until it's over.","Billy Wilder":"If you're going to tell people the truth, be funny or they'll kill you.","Chris Evans":"Fame is a funny thing. I like doing normal things. I like going to fairs. I like going to ball games. I like going to Disney World or a big field on the Fourth of July and having picnics with friends. The problem is you're either worried you're going to be recognized, or you're thankful you're not. It's always there.","Tom Petty":"It's funny how the music industry is enraged about the Internet and the way things are copied without being paid for. But you know why people steal the music? Because they can't afford the music.","Amy Childs":"When I have had a long day at work, I want something to watch that is funny, lighthearted and easy to get into, and reality is that. I'm not really into serious programmes or documentaries.","Rose Kennedy":"I'm like old wine. They don't bring me out very often - but I'm well preserved.","Katie McGrath":"Maybe people don't see me as believable playing a person of today. I guess I'm just more realistic in a corset and funny hairstyles.","Zsa Zsa Gabor":"I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house.","Rob Thomas":"It's funny: I always, as a high school teacher and particularly as a high school yearbook teacher, because yearbook staffs are 90 percent female, I got to sit in and overhear teenage girl talk for many years. I like teenage girls; I like their drama, their foibles. And I think, 'I'll be good with a teenage daughter!'","Joel Osteen":"Isn't it funny how babies laugh a lot? I read a toddler, a young child laughs 300 times a day. The average adult laughs, like, four times a day. God put it in them. He put the laugh in us, but I think sometimes we let life get us down, you know, have bad breaks, and we lose our breaks.","James Joyce":"Christopher Columbus, as everyone knows, is honored by posterity because he was the last to discover America.","Trevor Noah":"If I'm doing something on stage, and it evokes an emotion, then I might show that emotion, but I also don't believe in being a preacher. If you have a point, that's a bonus. But the funny has to come first; otherwise, you shouldn't call yourself a comedian.","Zach Galifianakis":"Inappropriateness is funny to me. Rudeness is hilarious.","Nate Silver":"When human judgment and big data intersect there are some funny things that happen.","Leslie Mann":"I've always surrounded myself with funny people.","Patrick Ness":"I get tired of comedies where there are a bunch of funny guys and a beautiful woman who doesn't do anything funny. And I don't like books where there's a rough-and-tumble boy and a really clever, snotty girl. That's just not my experience with teenagers.","Albert Brooks":"I don't want to be the one to break it to you, but the future ain't that funny.","James Thurber":"Progress was all right. Only it went on too long.","Barbara Corcoran":"A funny thing happens in real estate. When it comes back, it comes back up like gangbusters.","Bill Hicks":"It's always funny until someone gets hurt. Then it's just hilarious.","Jon Pardi":"I'm a funny guy. You've got to be able to make fun of yourself. We only live once.","D. B. Sweeney":"The great thing for me about 'The Resurrection of Gavin Stone' is it's a throwback to the old fashioned Hollywood movie that you can watch with your family, has a message, and is funny and entertaining. They didn't call them faith-based movies; they just called them good movies.","Ray Stevens":"The human brain is a funny thing: it's very susceptible to tempo and melody. You put the right words to it, and it becomes very influential.","Jimmy Carr":"I don't think it's any coincidence that I lost my religious faith and 'manned up' in the same year. I was described somewhere as a lapsed Catholic, which is funny because I'm not going back! I want to achieve things rather than live life in an animalistic way.","Mike Rowe":"It's funny; it's a real balancing act. In TV, everybody's talking about authenticity. In order to make 'Dirty Jobs' authentic, I really can't be overly informed. The minute I am, I become a host... It's a very tricky business paying a tribute to work, because TV is very bad at it.","Richard Simmons":"My persona has always been what a man was never supposed to be. Outrageous, gregarious, crazy, silly, funny.","Kristen Wiig":"With improv, it's a combination of listening and not trying to be funny.","Rick Baker":"It's a funny relationship that makeup artists have. I always feel kind of like a dentist. People look at me and think of pain.","Lalu Prasad Yadav":"I know some people say I can be funny. But there is always a deeper meaning to what I say. I am a socialist at heart and have the interests of the poor in mind. When people see how I manage to work my way out of tough situations, it gives them hope in their own life.","Anne Lamott":"I love readings and my readers, but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright, and the din of voices inside whisper that I am a fraud, and that the jig is up. Surely someone will rise up from the audience and say out loud that not only am I not funny and helpful, but I'm annoying, and a phony.","R. L. Stine":"I always just wanted to be funny. I never really planned to be scary.","Rowan Atkinson":"Funny things tend not to happen to me. I am not a natural comic. I need to think about things a lot before I can be even remotely amusing.","Kelly Ripa":"I'd rather not have a moment when I'm known for my looks; being funny and interesting lasts longer.","Toni Morrison":"I like marriage. The idea.","Billy Connolly":"My definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger.","Nikki Sixx":"The funny thing is that when you have any form of presentation to your band, meaning you have the foresight to see outside of your creativity, you have a bigger vision.","Magic Johnson":"I tell you, it's funny because the only time I think about HIV is when I have to take my medicine twice a day.","Bob Newhart":"I really don't know what makes a comedian. I think it's a family background and environment. Yet if you put the same ingredients in another person, he may never utter a funny line.","Jay Leno":"The reason there are two senators for each state is so that one can be the designated driver.","Sebastian Maniscalco":"I developed a knack for storytelling early on around the kitchen table with my family. I just happen to be a funny guy.","Bebe Rexha":"I just want to be myself and be real and be funny.","Colin Hanks":"'Lucky' is for laughs, and there's really nothing funny that I'm doing on 'Dexter.' I think more than anything, both comment on the fact that anybody is capable of anything. Just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesn't mean that they are a harmless little bunny.","Mick Ralphs":"The parrot's so funny. He imitates me and I don't even realize he's doing it. I'm walking around the house talking to myself and whistling and the next day he's said something I've said... it's scary you know?","Patti Scialfa":"I did feel funny about being fair and having red hair and freckles. I did not like that because I grew up in a neighbourhood where no one had red hair. I felt very conspicuous but not in a nice way.","Jim Morris":"I consider myself very lucky. God has a funny way of bringing some things around and knocking you in the head with the ultimate destination. Something I should have achieved quite easily took me a long time to get around to. It came in His time, not mine.","Orson Welles":"I have an unfortunate personality.","Eric Andre":"I don't think I would do a straight late-night talk show, like a 'Tonight Show' kind of thing. But I'm open to whatever is done well. I don't have any agenda. I'm not like Fugazi - I'm not trying to be just so punk rock until I die. Whatever is funny is good.","Kerry Washington":"I didn't grow up thinking I was pretty; there was always a prettier girl than me. So I learned to be smart and tried to be funny and develop the inside of me, because I felt like that's what I had.","Shaun White":"I wear black skinny-fit jeans - I can't get away from them. It's funny because I wore baggy jeans for ages, then one day my friend convinced me to try on a skinny pair and I thought they were great.","Hesiod":"Do not let a flattering woman coax and wheedle you and deceive you; she is after your barn.","Loni Love":"Life is funny, and that's why I celebrate it in my shows.","Naguib Mahfouz":"God did not intend religion to be an exercise club.","Maura Tierney":"I did a lot of sitcoms, and being funny isn't about being beautiful. Usually, beautiful people aren't the funny people.","Chandler Parsons":"I'm very lighthearted, outgoing, friendly, and funny, so I like to try new things.","Allison Jones":"Being funny is everything to me.","Katy Perry":"I wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning.","Eric Idle":"I like the idea of being out there regularly with an audience and with a funny gang of people. That's what I grew up with - doing television, doing shows every week.","Joseph Brodsky":"Who included me among the ranks of the human race?","Tracey Ullman":"Why does everyone think the future is space helmets, silver foil, and talking like computers, like a bad episode of Star Trek?","Norman Douglas":"Never take a solemn oath. People think you mean it.","Marcelene Cox":"If at first you don't succeed, blame your parents.","Kelly Corrigan":"It's funny, I'd rather be known as a writer who crafted a really nice piece about women's friendships over time. But that doesn't roll off the tongue like 'YouTube sensation.'","Robert Byrne":"Until you walk a mile in another man's moccasins you can't imagine the smell.","Richard Lewis":"When you're in love it's the most glorious two and a half days of your life.","Sam Levenson":"Lead us not into temptation. Just tell us where it is; we'll find it.","David Lee Roth":"I used to jog but the ice cubes kept falling out of my glass.","Charles Dudley Warner":"Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.","Donald Trump":"You know the funny thing, I don't get along with rich people. I get along with the middle class and the poor people better than I get along with the rich people.","Edward Abbey":"Society is like a stew. If you don't stir it up every once in a while then a layer of scum floats to the top.","Roy Orbison":"I may be a living legend, but that sure don't help when I've got to change a flat tire.","Charles Kettering":"Thinking is one thing no one has ever been able to tax.","Kendall Jenner":"My ideal prom date would have to be cute, funny, sweet, nice.","Jeff Kinney":"I think if everyone would write down the funny stories from their own childhoods, the world would be a better place.","Walt Whitman":"I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don't believe I deserved my friends.","Laura Benanti":"I think that I come off as, 'Nothing bothers me, I don't care! I'm funny and sassy.' But I'm deeply sensitive. Not only about myself but to others. Not to pat myself on the back, empathy is a quality I've cultivated over my life. It came naturally to me as a child.","Scott Hamilton":"What was really funny is that as I got older all those guys who called me a sissy in junior high school wanted me to be their best friend because they wanted to meet all the girls that I knew in figure skating.","Bette Davis":"I'd luv to kiss ya, but I just washed my hair.","Demetri Martin":"Stand up is really fun because if I think of a joke or a funny idea, then I can just go and tell some people and if they laugh, they laugh right away.","Stephen Fry":"I don't need you to remind me of my age. I have a bladder to do that for me.","Chad Michael Murray":"To all the girls out there who think being funny is not sexy, you are wrong!","Steve Harvey":"There's a lot more to me than just funny.","Jerry Lewis":"I turned down 'Some Like It Hot.' See how smart I am? I felt I couldn't bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don't need to compete with the wardrobe.","Alexander Woollcott":"Everything I like is either illegal, immoral or fattening.","Tom Hanks":"At the end of the day it's got to be a good movie, it's got to be a funny movie, and it's got to make people think, 'Hey, I couldn't have spent my time any better.'","Danny Boyle":"It's not so much what you learn about Mumbai, it's what you learn about yourself, really. It's a funny old hippie thing, but it's true as well. You find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance, and about your inclusiveness.","Don Rickles":"Some people say funny things, but I say things funny.","Arthur Conan Doyle":"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.","Leonardo DiCaprio":"I got attention by being funny at school, pretending to be retarded, and jumping around with a deformed hand.","Louis XIV":"I could sooner reconcile all Europe than two women.","Edward Albee":"Careers are funny things. They begin mysteriously and, just as mysteriously, they can end; and I am at just the very beginning of what I hope will be a long and satisfying life in the theater. But, whatever happens, I am grateful to have had my novice work received so well, and so quickly.","Agyness Deyn":"The fact is I'm choosy, but mainly about a man's character. He has to be interesting, funny and clever. I don't even mind if he's not very good-looking.","Audrey Hepburn":"I was asked to act when I couldn't act. I was asked to sing 'Funny Face' when I couldn't sing, and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn't dance - and do all kinds of things I wasn't prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it.","Virat Kohli":"Unless someone wants to look funny, I'll not recommend anyone to copy my bowling action. But on a serious note, with the confidence that I have got from the amount of runs I have been scoring, when I'm thrown the ball to bowl, I am pretty sure of what I have to do. I may not be the most attractive to watch while bowling, but I can be effective.","Bill Engvall":"It's funny: people who meet me say, 'I thought you'd be different.' But I'm still the same guy.","Larry David":"You have to discover when you're inadequate to be funny and you don't know you're inadequate when you're a kid.","Andre Maurois":"Conversation would be vastly improved by the constant use of four simple words: I do not know.","Tyler Joseph":"It's a funny thing. I'll be in my home town of Columbus at a restaurant or something, and the waiter maybe asks, 'What do you do?' and I say, 'Oh, I'm in a band... Twenty One Pilots,' and he'll say, 'Cool, I'll check it out. I never heard of them.' And then I say, 'In September we're playing the Schottenstein Center,' and it's like, 'What?!'","Nargis Fakhri":"Ritesh Deshmukh is rock star. He has a lovely family. He works so hard, and he's a great actor. He's funny, friendly, doesn't have an ego, and is so nice to everyone. He's a fine professional, a good husband, and a good father. That's a rock star for me.","Medgar Evers":"It may sound funny, but I love the South. I don't choose to live anywhere else. There's land here, where a man can raise cattle, and I'm going to do it some day.","George Jean Nathan":"An optimist is a fellow who believes a housefly is looking for a way to get out.","Esther Williams":"When you're out of sight for as long as I was, there's a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again.","Maya Angelou":"Everyone has at least one story, and each of us is funny if we admit it. You have to admit you're the funniest person you've ever heard of.","Gertrude Stein":"I know what Germans are. They are a funny people. They are always choosing someone to lead them in a direction which they do not want to go.","Salman Rushdie":"Stories in families are colossally important. Every family has stories: some funny, some proud, some embarrassing, some shameful. Knowing them is proof of belonging to the family.","Milo Yiannopoulos":"The thing I most hate about the Left is that they want to stop us laughing - to prescribe which jokes are OK and which are not OK to make in public and to draw artificial lines around certain subjects. I find all sorts of inappropriate things funny.","Garry Shandling":"But I really like hosting, I think it's a strength of mine. It allows me to improvise, and I love the spontaneity of that, and I think I'm funny behind the desk when interviewing someone.","Cardi B":"I'm a funny person, but I take my music seriously.","Ron Funches":"Being nice can be funny. A lot of my jokes are like, 'Let me take a bad situation and try to put the best spin on it.'","Jerry Stiller":"During the Great Depression, when people laughed their worries disappeared. Audiences loved these funny men. I decided to become one.","Kaitlin Olson":"Being mean just for being mean's sake isn't funny.","Saint Augustine":"O Lord, help me to be pure, but not yet.","Will Ferrell":"My kind of wanting to be funny didn't come from need, necessarily. The closest I can analyze it is that it was an easy way to make friends, I found out. It was just a great kind of social tool.","Angelina Jolie":"I am odd-looking. I sometimes think I look like a funny Muppet.","W. Clement Stone":"What contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch?","Seth Rogen":"To me, what separates a funny movie from a good movie is something personal.","Lupita Nyong'o":"It's so funny, you go to acting school thinking you're going to learn how to be other people, but really it taught me how to be myself. Because it's in understanding yourself deeply that you can lend yourself to another person's circumstances and another person's experience.","Jennifer Aniston":"Life can be dramatic and funny all in the same day.","Amy Poehler":"Always remember your kid's name. Always remember where you put your kid. Don't let your kid drive until their feet can reach the pedals. Use the right size diapers... for yourself. And, when in doubt, make funny faces.","Kara Walker":"I'm fascinated with the stories that we tell. Real histories become fantasies and fairy tales, morality tales and fables. There's something interesting and funny and perverse about the way fairytale sometimes passes for history, for truth.","Benjamin Jowett":"One man is as good as another until he has written a book.","Robert Crais":"Sometimes I am so dry that people don't know I'm kidding and think I'm being serious. I enjoy this because their reactions are often funny.","Jean Baudrillard":"There is nothing funny about Halloween. This sarcastic festival reflects, rather, an infernal demand for revenge by children on the adult world.","Daisy Ridley":"I love Felicity Jones. It was funny because I went to go see the 'Rogue One' set, and I was like, 'Oh my God, I love you.' And she's so tiny, and elegant, and she's just so small. Everyone's so much smaller than they seem.","Matthew Stafford":"I really like 'Gladiator.' I like 'The Dark Knight.' I really liked, when I was a kid, 'U.S. Marshalls.' I like funny movies, too. 'Old School' and 'The Hangover.' 'The Hangover' was up there; I liked it.","Emo Philips":"I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator.","Alfred Hitchcock":"Television has brought back murder into the home - where it belongs.","Roseanne Barr":"I always felt that it was easier to take a funny person and teach them to write television than to take somebody who was a television writer and make them funny. And I discovered a lot of great writers that went on to do a lot of great shows like 'Seinfeld,' 'Friends,' you know, 'Three and a Half Men.'","Joan Jett":"The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, 'What are you talking about?' Even just seemingly regular career paths, but if it's not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.","Larry the Cable Guy":"What I do onstage, there's maybe .0001 percent of the population that acts like that. I talk like that because it makes me laugh, and because I know a couple of people that talk like that. They're really that Southern. And they do funny things. I love 'em; they're awesome. They're good people.","Robert Vaughn":"'Hustle' is wonderfully enjoyable because all my life, I've made an effort to be with people who can make me laugh. That original cast - Marc Warren, Jaime Murray, Robert Glenister and Adrian Lester - are all funny. So I know every day I'll have a few good laughs.","Fanny Brice":"Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustn't get serious with people. They don't expect it from you, and they don't want to see it. You're not entitled to be serious, you're a clown.","Christine Teigen":"It's funny because I want my teeth to be, like, neon 'Real Housewives' white, but mine have stopped taking to teeth whitening. When I talk to my dentist, I'm like, 'They can be that white,' and he's like, 'Veneers can be that white.'","Kim Swift":"The drawings in 'Portal' were actually me scribbling that stuff... I had a funny moment when I realized that someone gotten 'The cake is a lie' tattooed on themselves. It was really interesting to see my handwriting tattooed on another human being. That... that's odd.","Matthew Bourne":"My company is known for being funny as well as moving. You get a bit of everything in these shows. I think people know they're going to have a surprising experience.","Henry David Thoreau":"If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.","Meghan Markle":"Every day after school for 10 years, I was on the set of 'Married... with Children,' which is a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic school uniform to grow up.","Dennis Miller":"There's nothing wrong with being shallow as long as you're insightful about it.","Heath Ledger":"I'm just not one of those naturally funny, relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it.","Shaquille O'Neal":"As a youngster, my mother and father always drilled into my head having something to fall back on. My father was kind of funny. I'd score 40 points. I'd come home and say, 'Look dad, I scored 40.' He'd never have a smile on his face. He'd be like, 'I saw that move you did. What if you'd hurt your knee?'","Justin Bieber":"Cheryl Cole and Katy Perry are two of the hottest girls in the world - and so normal and funny with it. If I was a few years older they are the kind of girls I'd like to date. I want a younger version of Cheryl and Katy - a mixture of the two would be hot.","John Oliver":"You just try to be true to your idea of what is funny and what is also interesting.","Paris Hilton":"I'm blonde and tanned and normal-sized! I'm sweet, shy, funny, have a big heart and I'm nice - and I like to eat.","Missy Elliott":"Its funny, because for females in general - not just in music, but the corporate ladder as well - anything we do has always been harder for us. When it comes to music, the industry wants you to conform, to look like this and to sound like this and do this or that. It makes it harder. It's harder for us to come out and be bosses and lead the pack.","PewDiePie":"I make funny videos of me playing video games, and I share those moments.","Peter Capaldi":"I always thought it was funny that my grandparents had bought a ticket to New York and ended up in Glasgow.","Seth MacFarlane":"We never really tried to shock for shock's sake on 'Family Guy'. If something was horribly offensive and shocking, we would put it in if it was also hysterically funny.","Paul Haggis":"'Crash' came from personal experience. I saw things inside me from living in L.A. that made me uncomfortable. I saw horrible things in people and saw terrible things in myself. I saw a black director completely humiliated, but the three people around me just thought it was funny. 'No,' I said, 'that is selling your soul.'","Liam Hemsworth":"I love my brothers' kids. It's funny - as an uncle, you become so protective of them.","Sean Hayes":"There weren't any funny people in sports or the Spanish club. All the really creative, witty, funny people that made your belly hurt were in the theater program.","Lynda Barry":"I need to be cheered up a lot. I think funny people are people who need to be cheered up.","Lorrie Moore":"I've never been to a dinner party where everyone at the dinner table didn't say something funny.","Barry Marshall":"My mother was a nurse, and in her era, most diseases weren't understood; people put mustard plasters on knees and rubbed camphor on your chest if you had a cough and did funny things to you if you had tuberculosis - all these things that really made very little difference once proper treatments were brought in.","Don Herold":"There's one thing about baldness, it's neat.","Simone Elkeles":"Everyone who has ever met me for at least five minutes knows I'm a really funny person. I love to laugh and to make people laugh, so writing comedy comes naturally to me.","Al Jolson":"I have seen and heard comedians who had really funny 'stuff' but yet could not make the people laugh; then, again - I have seen others whose stuff was anything but humorous, and the audience would howl with laughter.","Ernest Hemingway":"A man's got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book.","Lee Trevino":"Only bad golfers are lucky. They're the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.","Eddie Murphy":"I'm 42 and the age of a guy who has kids, so I guess I'm playing right where I'm supposed to be. I'm comfortable with that, but in the same breath I'd do something edgy. If someone came to me and offered me an edgy and funny story, then I'd do it.","Greg Boyle":"I always have a funny story at communion time that underscores that no one is perfect, and that communion is not for perfect people but for hungry people.","Jake Paul":"I'm in the lane where I can make music but also have it be funny and still good at the same time.","Roger Federer":"To handle that stardom, the red carpets, the photo shoots, people all of a sudden recognizing you and following you in everyday life, it's a bit weird. It's strange, and it can have funny effects on you in terms of do you like it or don't you like it. Some people run away from it, some people embrace it; I found a good middle ground.","Rob Lowe":"I've never met a funny person who wasn't smart. I've met a lot of dramatic people who were stupid. But I've never met a funny person who wasn't smart.","Ricky Gervais":"I wanted to be clever, but being funny came first. That's how you know someone is clever. They don't come out and tell you pi to 13 places - they tell you a joke.","Dane Cook":"If you use tact you can say anything, then make it funny.","Elaine Stritch":"You can't be funny unless you're tragic, and you can't be tragic unless you're funny.","Terry Crews":"I'm not a big prank guy, because I don't like them done to me. I've been on movies sets where one guys goes into his trailer, and then people move the stairs, and he comes out of his trailer, and there's no stairs. That's not funny! I don't want to be that guy!","Tom Baker":"One longs to be funny, to make people laugh. Laughter is such a sign of approval, isn't it?","Tucker Max":"No one wants to read a story where I saw a cute puppy on the street and I petted it. I mean, that's not funny. I only write about the funny stuff.","Paula Poundstone":"I don't have a bank account because I don't know my mother's maiden name.","Joe E. Lewis":"The way taxes are, you might as well marry for love.","Rickie Fowler":"All you can do is really the prep work and make sure you're ready to hit each golf shot. Outside of that, you're not sure really what's going to happen. It's a funny game, but I think that's why I love it. You never know, one day to the next; you could go shoot 62, and the next day you're going to shoot 78, and you can't predict it.","Alexi Zentner":"My daughters are both funny and smart and lots of fun. They play lacrosse, soccer, musical instruments, like to cook with me, and are naturals in the swimming pool. Honestly, though, what I like doing most with them is eating. I've worked really hard to make sure they are willing to try all sorts of different foods.","Louie Anderson":"I had been asking the universe and God to send me a way for me to help me. Show business has been so wonderful to me, and it came in the form of that. It's just so funny how things come into your life, and if you take a chance on them, it might give you a brand new life.","Katharine Ross":"Funny thing, as you become famous, people write less nice things about you.","Ted Lindsay":"But a funny thing happened four years later. I was invited to play for an alumni team against the Red Wings.","Sally Quinn":"Funny you mention my dinner parties when I have just suggested that inviting close friends over to share a meal with candlelight and wine at your table could be a form of religious experience for some people. To me it's a form of sacrament.","Jarrett J. Krosoczka":"What's funny is that an old Web site of mine just had one fake bio, and everyone went crazy for it. So when I made the new Web site, I thought, 'I just need to make this one even more absurd.'","Harold Wilson":"I'm an optimist, but an optimist who carries a raincoat.","Ryan Hansen":"Girls don't poop, so don't claim you do. You can fart - because farting is funny - but we don't want to know that you poop.","Jane Wagner":"When we talk to God, we're praying. When God talks to us, we're schizophrenic.","Bill Murray":"One of the things I like about acting is that, in a funny way, I come back to myself.","Dwayne Johnson":"The men I idolized built their bodies and became somebody - like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger - and I thought, 'That can be me.' So I started working out. The funny thing is I didn't realize back then that I was having a defining moment.","Jamie Foxx":"You know what? I never really factor Hollywood into anything. I'm a black actor, so I can't really control what Hollywood thinks. I gotta go do my thing, and my jokes have got to be funny. Whatever I do has got to be great.","Chris Pratt":"The American audience has really opened up to women being A.) funny and B.) kinda crude. 'Bridesmaids' is R-rated, and I think it was a major coup for women to have an R-rated comedy that did really well. Same as 'Bad Teacher.'","Danny DeVito":"What you do with it and things like that, but I basically chose this after I read it because I thought it was different and funny and unique and dark - things that I like to do.","Emma Stone":"My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I'm just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It's not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.","Thomas Szasz":"Two wrongs don't make a right, but they make a good excuse.","Pamela Anderson":"My career only took off because of one football game. I thought it was funny. 'Playboy' called and offered me a cover just like that. I turned them down initially, because I was nervous about it and my boyfriend at the time didn't want me to do it, but they kept coming back, so I eventually said yes.","Pharrell Williams":"I have an all-Japanese design team, and none of them speak English. So it's often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation.","George A. Romero":"For a Catholic kid in parochial school, the only way to survive the beatings - by classmates, not the nuns - was to be the funny guy.","Barbara Walters":"I was the kind nobody thought could make it. I had a funny Boston accent. I couldn't pronounce my R's. I wasn't a beauty.","Terry Bradshaw":"You find out in life that people really like you funny. So what do you give 'em? Humor. And then if you show them the other side, they don't like you as much. I find, too, that I can hide behind the idiot's mask being funny, and you never see the sorrow or the pain.","Twiggy":"Sometimes I can't believe I'm going to be 60. I always say there's no point moaning about getting older, when there's nothing you can do about it. But still, I do find it quite funny. I look at that number, 60, and I think, 'Really? Me?'","Howard Jacobson":"People often think that you have a sense of humor because you think that life is funny. Life isn't funny at all. It's appalling and tragic.","Hugh Grant":"The reason I turn down 99% of a hundred, I mean a thousand, scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny.","Nikki Reed":"I feel like every day of my life is a funny wardrobe malfunction!","Mac DeMarco":"I don't necessarily like wearing lipstick; I just think it's funny to do. I think the darker the better, but it's whatever my girlfriend Kiera has in her purse.","J. B. Priestley":"She was a handsome woman of forty-five and would remain so for many years.","Pete Davidson":"Things that I feel really sad about, I talk about. That way, if it's funny, it doesn't hurt anymore.","T. J. Miller":"It's much better to wreak havoc on a show and be a maniac than promote myself. Plugs and anecdotes aren't really in line with my beliefs. Besides, if someone sees me on a morning show and thinks, 'That's not funny; this guy is crazy,' then I don't want them to come to the show anyway.","Sonia Rykiel":"I always believe in pants. You can play with your legs, your attitude, with pants. It's much more funny. It's much more sophisticated. It's much more arrogant, like a man with feminine attitude. I love pants.","Wanda Sykes":"People are getting careers from YouTube and uploading videos. And they're totally different - you can't necessarily be funny on a video, and then all of a sudden you're live in a theater. You don't have the tools yet. It's a lot more involved to go from being funny on a little iPhone screen to being live in front of people and being funny.","Twinkle Khanna":"'Mrs Funnybones' is based and structured around my columns, and it's about how a modern woman looks at India and how India looks right back at her. Since I have a weakness for illustrations, there are also a few funny illustrations in there as well.","Andra Day":"My sister and I - she's a musician - we jam all the time. We always play around for giggles with stuff that seem unconventional or stuff that seems funny. A lot of the stuff sometimes is just a response from jam sessions in her room, so she'll be on the guitar or the keyboard, and we'll just start singing and doing stuff.","Fred Willard":"There's different kinds of improv. There's Second City improv where you try to slowly build a nice sketch. There's stuff you do in college coffee houses where you just go joke, joke, joke. Bring another funny character with a funny hat on his head. Christopher Guest is more the line of trying to get a story out.","Sparky Anderson":"Me carrying a briefcase is like a hotdog wearing earrings.","Paul Feig":"I love funny people, and when I'm with funny people, or people who are amusing in their weirdness, I love it. Because that to me is funny, as opposed to someone who stops and says, 'Hey let me tell you a joke.'","Stephen Merchant":"The reason I keep talking about a wife and saying the word 'wife' on stage is because it seems a funny word to me. The more you say it, the more it seems to detach from that person and become this sort of abstract thing: that you would set out to find a wife, that it would be an objective like buying a new car.","Pete Wentz":"I like idolator.com a lot. Every once in a while they shred me on there, but it's usually pretty funny.","Imelda Marcos":"I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.","Michael Gambon":"Maybe that is why kids like Dumbledore: because he is funny rather than a miserable old sod with a long white beard.","Hank Azaria":"Being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in.","Tasha Smith":"Mr. Idris Elba is amazing! He happens to be British, but what's funny about him is that when he's speaking in his American dialect, he looks like he's a brother from the 'hood. But as soon as he brings out that English thing, I'm like, 'Woo! You look like you're from London. Oh my God!' It's like everything on him changes. He's so cool!","Emily Browning":"With my boyfriend, we can make sexist jokes to each other because we know it's absolutely not true. If I get home from a long day and he says: 'Go on, get in the kitchen,' it's funny because we know it's not our lives.","Jeff Ross":"My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles were all funny, and I felt that energy, that delivery, that timing, that sarcasm. All that stuff seeped into my brain.","Calvin Trillin":"As far as I'm concerned, 'whom' is a word that was invented to make everyone sound like a butler.","Shaun Tan":"Animals represent the abstract notion of acceptance. Living with these funny creatures - you kind of have to accept them. It's like a test in a way.","Michael Buble":"I am a candid interview and I have a dark and dry sense of humor - a very Canadian sense of humor and I am only learning now stupidly that you can't read tongue. When I say something funny in a newspaper and I meant it to be funny, it doesn't read that way.","Kate Spade":"I buy so much fake jewelry, it's funny. It's not real. I don't wear real diamonds or anything.","Elisabeth Moss":"I heard that people were really interested in the new haircut, which I think is so funny. Great haircut, I really like it. It goes great with the time period. And I was super, super, super-happy to have my bangs swept to the side rather than straight in front of me, which I dealt with for three seasons. I'm very, very much done with that.","Reg E. Cathey":"It's funny how getting older - or being overlooked and underrated for more than two decades - can make you change your ambitions.","Julie Newmar":"Tell me I'm beautiful, it's nothing. Tell me I'm intellectual - I know it. Tell me I'm funny, and it's the greatest compliment in the world anyone could give me.","Jimmy Reed":"If you just stop and think, baby, honey, love is a funny thing. Whatever you put in, that's what you expect to gain.","Bill Gates":"The 'Billionaire' song is what my kids tease me with. They sing it to me. It's funny.","Margaret Thatcher":"It's a funny old world.","Prince":"I'm thankful enough or blessed enough to be able to say that Miles Davis was a friend when he was alive, and he was a wonderful mentor and really, really funny, you know.","Conor McGregor":"I see fighters make funny videos about me and stick them on Facebook and get 20 likes. When I make a video, I sell it to Fox and make seven figures. That's the difference.","Marilyn Manson":"I don't say things to be offensive; I say things because they're funny to me. It amuses me.","Rihanna":"I'd love to date somebody cool, fun, funny.","Bo Burnham":"There's only one rule in stand-up, which is that you have to be funny. Yet 99 per cent of comics look and talk exactly the same.","Al Gore":"The day I made that statement, about the inventing the internet, I was tired because I'd been up all night inventing the Camcorder.","Tom Stoppard":"I'm good at being funny.","Joe Biden":"I used to stutter really badly. Everybody thinks it's funny. And it's not funny. It's not.","Tom Hiddleston":"If you play it straight it's funny - the best comedy is always played straight down the middle. The adjustment is understanding from the screenplay that a moment is hilarious.","Reese Witherspoon":"It's funny that it all becomes about clothes. It's bizarre. You work your butt off and then you win an award and it's all about your dress. You can't get away from it.","Bill Maher":"Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease.","Tracy Morgan":"'Saturday Night Live' was like a university for funny.","Garth Brooks":"It's funny how a chubby kid can just be having fun, and people call it entertainment!","Les Dawson":"I used to sell furniture for a living. The trouble was, it was my own.","Khloe Kardashian":"It's hysterical how kids have their own personalities, even at like 3 or 4. And, it's funny what they tend to like.","J. D. Salinger":"What I like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.","Matthew Desmond":"You meet folks who are funny and really smart and persistent and loving that are confronting this thing we call poverty, which is just a shorthand for this way of life that holds you underwater. And you just wonder what our country would be if we allowed these people to flourish and reach their full potential.","Shah Rukh Khan":"Without hurting anybody, we all tend to laugh at others' discomfort. When someone slips on a banana skin and falls it's funny.","Gene Wilder":"I'm funny on camera sometimes. In life, once in a while. Once in a while.","David Letterman":"I cannot sing, dance or act; what else would I be but a talk show host.","Mary Ellen Mark":"Every photograph is the photographer's opinion about something. It's how they feel about something: what they think is horrible, tragic, funny.","Edgar Wright":"Growing up, there were TV shows that were very funny but very traditional. Classic things like 'Fawlty Towers,' obviously, and 'Blackadder' were pretty traditionally shot. And then there were the ones that start to break the mold or be really ambitious. The ones that spring particularly to mind would be 'The Young Ones.'","Greta Gerwig":"When you write something you know, you're making a story that will work, whether or not there's bits taken. It's always funny to me when people say, 'Well, it's clearly autobiographical,' and I say, 'Well, how do you know my autobiography?' Certainly, there are things that are connected, but I just think it's a very interesting assumption.","Tim Vine":"People ask 'do you make a conscious effort not to swear?' - if you're doing silly stuff you're not tempted to put swearing in. All the comics from my childhood, who were funny without swearing, were the people that influenced me. What I do is quite traditional anyway.","Alexis Ohanian":"Being effective at social media, whether for business or personal use, means capturing people who have short attention spans. They're only a click away from a picture of a funny cat, so you have to make your thing more compelling than that cat. And that can be a high bar.","Ashley Tisdale":"I just love carbs. And when I'm on vacation I definitely allow myself carbs, so it's always funny when people are like, 'Oh my gosh, you look great in your bikini.' I'm like, 'If you only knew what I had for breakfast!'","Beth Ditto":"Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film 'Funny Girl' at least five times, eat at least 45 chocolate bars, and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex. I truly believe that, through a combination of Nutella, old pals and Barbra Streisand, we can achieve happiness and, very probably, world peace.","Louis Theroux":"I feel like, if there's an elephant in the room, I'd really like to start off by introducing the elephant in the room. And sometimes it's funny.","Busy Philipps":"I've always liked being funny and making people laugh. I was a cut-up when I was a kid and was always doing bits for my friends and family. I remember doing pratfalls on the playground in fourth grade for my friend and really hurting my hip.","Kangana Ranaut":"In my film 'Queen', there was a funny moment with the bra. My director called and said they are blurring the bra. They said it is vulgar. Our director was furious about it. We are artistes... We see props as they are. A woman's bra is not a danger to the society.","Emily Ratajkowski":"It's a weird thing. Rick Springfield wrote 'Jessie's Girl,' and he probably gets sick of talking about 'Jessie's Girl.' The thing is, I didn't write 'Blurred Lines.' I didn't direct the music video. I'm really happy for the success, but it is kind of a funny thing to follow me around.","Laura Bush":"They're great girls. They're very funny, they're very smart, they're fun to be with. They're very lively, as I think people can tell. And you know, they're very confident girls.","Jim Brown":"The funny thing about cinema is, usually when they do a story that has African Americans in it, there always has to be a white guy who's the savior.","Naomi Campbell":"I would ask my mother to show me how to walk - and she did show me. That's why I think it's funny when people say, 'Did so-and-so teach you how to walk?' And I always say, 'You must be talking about my mother, because it was my mother who taught me how to walk.'","Norman Wisdom":"I was born in very sorry circumstances. Both of my parents were very sorry.","Noah Baumbach":"As a kid, I thought of myself as a funny person who secretly wanted to be serious, but now I think maybe I'm a serious person who secretly wants to be funny.","John Niven":"There are precedents for what happens when societies allow the divide between rich and poor to get so huge that it stops being funny and starts becoming a sick, blood-boiling joke. If you had a Tardis, you could go back to 1917 and ask the Russian royal family how it was all going.","Abbi Jacobson":"I definitely started to perform a little bit in middle school, but not the typical musical/play route. I think that I am funny, but it was more of a social thing, where that was my part in my circle of friends.","Cathy Guisewite":"Defy your own group. Rebel against yourself.","Dav Pilkey":"I think my funny books are my favorites because I like to laugh so much.","Brittany Snow":"I'm so single. It's funny. I'm usually a relationship girl. I love being in love and having a partner in crime. But it's good to be your own partner in crime. God, that makes me sound like I have multiple-personality disorder.","Elayne Boosler":"I have six locks on my door all in a row. When I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three.","Sabrina Carpenter":"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all. And if you do have to say it, make it really funny so I can screenshot it and save it for later.","Caroline Rhea":"Someone told me that when they go to Vermont, they feel like they're home. I'm that way at Saks.","Patty Duke":"I joke around a lot about the manic times because they're funny. We manics do outrageous things and it is part of our colorful nature.","Jens Voigt":"Crashing is never funny, but sometimes you can jump up, laugh at your stupidity, and go, 'What the hell was that?'","Sally Phillips":"I have a lot of funny friends, though not everyone's funny all the time. Doon Mackichan's my funniest friend in the pub; Nina Conti's the funniest with a monkey.","Sheryl Crow":"People don't realize that I'm really funny and I'm an excellent bridge player.","Natasha Lyonne":"I'm somebody who believes in funny things, and laughing, but I do like for them to come from a place that addresses the human condition.","Josh Zuckerman":"In entertainment, I adore Ricky Gervais in 'Derek.' His performance is unbelievably charming, funny and poignant. In life, I adore my girlfriend. She is the most adorable person I have ever met - from her silly jokes to her cute teeth to her little drawings.","Garrett Hedlund":"It's funny, though, speaking of fathers and sons, because me and John Goodman played father and son, like, five or six years ago in the film 'Death Sentence,' and I got back with him again in 'Inside Llewyn Davis.'","Tessa Thompson":"Fashion is a funny thing to talk about. I think what you wear is definitely an extension of you, but I also think it's totally arbitrary.","Jason Mitchell":"I want people to have learned from me. When you watch movies that we grew up on, they teach you life lessons about friendship, brotherhood, integrity, but it's still funny and something you can watch as a family. I want to bring that back to our culture in general.","Chris Isaak":"I remember listening to the radio as a kid and finding that the songs always made me feel more peaceful. Funny, but the more hurtin' the music was, the better it made me feel. I think of that now when I write my songs. I may not be feelin' the blues myself, but I'm writing them for other people who have a hard life.","Kim Fields":"It's funny how God will just keep using you, and our motto around our family forever has been, 'Just let Him use you.'","Edith Sitwell":"I wish the government would put a tax on pianos for the incompetent.","Katie Nolan":"You are not just a funny person or just a journalist. Most people are hybrids of having a smart opinion and a great sense of humor.","Roland Joffe":"I'm not a very serious person. You know how they say that clowns are very funny in public and are really sad at home? I'm really kind of stupid at home and more serious in public.","Peter Sellers":"I'm a classic example of all humorists - only funny when I'm working.","Magnus Scheving":"My boy and I move. We have this game where if we dress in a particular item of clothing, we have to do a different movement. A hat means 20 jumps - that sort of thing. When I put a scarf on, my son has to drop down and do push-ups, immediately. He thinks it's really funny.","Kian Lawley":"I went from basically filming in my bedroom by myself, filming some funny videos, and then overnight, I switched into filming in some studios and some warehouses and family homes. I started filming with directors and producers and editors, and there were so many people in the room, so it was definitely weird.","Martin Short":"I think I'm funny because my family, my siblings were funny.","Colman Domingo":"My brothers and sister and me grew up making fun of each other, the way we'd speak or move. When we get together, everyone's funny, quick, loud, and speaks on top of each other. It was like a great comedy school; nothing is precious.","Kate Klise":"I want to give kids that fall-off-the-bed-laughing feeling. Either that, or the sixth-grade feeling that life is hard - sometimes unbearably hard - and it is ultimately about death. But in the meantime, life can be really funny, too.","Charlotte McKinney":"I can really stir up a conversation. Every time I go to a meeting or a casting, I try to make it as light and funny as I can. I'm always making really awkward jokes. You have to make life fun and not take it too seriously. I may look like I'm very serious and into my work, but if you knew me, I'm just a jokester.","Yvette Nicole Brown":"I think God has a sense of humor, and the way my lessons come from God is very funny. I have to laugh at myself even if it's a tough lesson.","David Heyman":"I think it's great to see how they've grown up, not just as actors but as people. They're still very much the same kids that I met many years ago. They've grown up and they are funny and wicked and naughty and bright, and I think as actors their work is just getting better and better. They've blossomed.","BeBe Winans":"Life is funny, and a lot of times, the people that I've met have really gone past anything that I've ever dreamed of, so I'm really grateful. My friendships really go from the West to the East. You'd be amazed at some of the people I call friends.","Guido van Rossum":"If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit you can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is, from a language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with Python, but it is sort of a restricted subset.","Pete Postlethwaite":"When I made a breakthrough as an actor, people started to say, 'Who's that bloke with the funny name?' They advised me to change it, saying it would never be put up in lights outside theaters because they couldn't afford the electricity. But I would never contemplate changing it. It's who I am.","Maxim Knight":"In preschool, I would plan out my show-and-tell every week to be funny and exciting. Then in first grade I wrote a play, and my classmates and I performed it as a puppet show.","Ricky Van Veen":"Viral videos aren't just about being funny. They're about identity creation.","Claude Pepper":"A stockbroker urged me to buy a stock that would triple its value every year. I told him, 'At my age, I don't even buy green bananas.'","Margaret Smith":"My uncle Sammy was an angry man. He had printed on his tombstone: What are you looking at?","Jerry Trainor":"I definitely knew I wanted to be an actor in high school. I was doing plays and musicals, and I loved 'Saturday Night Live' and thought that was what I wanted to do - funny sketches and comedies. So I knew then, but I didn't know how to go about it, but I found my way.","LeBron James":"I'm a pretty funny guy, and I would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys - movie-star guys, where they could help me through it.","Andy Warhol":"I used to think that everything was just being funny but now I don't know. I mean, how can you tell?","Tom Brady":"I'm attracted to women who are smart and funny and ambitious and have lives of their own and great families. Isn't that what attracts anyone?","Benjamin Disraeli":"As for our majority... one is enough.","Samuel Johnson":"One of the disadvantages of wine is that it makes a man mistake words for thoughts.","Thomas Hardy":"You can do anything with bayonets except sit on them.","Karl Lagerfeld":"I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it's OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.","Dave Chappelle":"I was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible. I felt I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed.","Shigeru Miyamoto":"Japanese people have a funny habit of abbreviating names.","Lana Del Rey":"I have kind of a funny relationship with movies. I don't have to see the whole movie to get an impression of it or to let it have an influence on me.","Lewis Black":"All the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911.","Rita Moreno":"There is something about sex that always brings out the funny in me. I think it's because we make such fools of ourselves over it.","Benedict Cumberbatch":"Do I like being thought of as attractive? I don't know anyone on Earth who doesn't, but I do find it funny.","Steve Carell":"I had a friend who, after 25 years of marriage, found himself trying to date again, and it was completely different. Everything had changed, and he had to reacquaint himself. It was funny even talking to him about it. For someone who has been out of the loop, it's a different world.","Patton Oswalt":"Lot of ugly funny dudes end up with some pretty gorgeous women. Women are much deeper than us in choosing a mate - they see in the long term.","Bernie Mac":"I'm funny. I'm a comedian. I'm not a clown.","Billy Crystal":"To me, little Mike Wazowski is one of the best characters I ever got to play because he was funny. He was outrageous. He got angry. He was romantic. He was a full, well-rounded character.","Jeff Bridges":"It's funny. You succeed, but now where are you gonna go from there? I've got to keep proving that I can laugh or cry more real each time.","Tom DeLonge":"Humor has become so cliche and boring that nothing's funny anymore unless it involves something totally disgusting that offends somebody or makes them feel really uncomfortable.","Michael Caine":"My wife, my daughters, even my grandchildren are funny. You've got to keep a sense of humor because anger destroys you.","Aisha Tyler":"As a comedian, it really gelled when I started doing standup. Because standup is so much about bravery, especially in the early days. There is no doubt that it is going to go terribly for you over and over and over again. But you cannot get funny without bombing.","Melissa McCarthy":"Funny is funny, and it can come in 8 billion different shades and flavors, so I think it's silly to kind of limit it.","Allison Williams":"I've done so many funny jobs. I worked at a farmer's market through high school. I worked in the stock room of Ralph Lauren. I graduated to salesperson at Ralph Lauren, which was a big deal to me. I've been a P.A. I've been a stand-in. I've been an assistant's assistant.","Samuel Butler":"Parents are the last people on earth who ought to have children.","Mike Birbiglia":"There's nothing funny the first time about telling a story about getting beat up and it makes you leave high school.","Gigi Hadid":"Twitter is the place where I try to be more funny. And then I use Instagram just as my diary. I pull some jokes on there, but I think people have a better sense of humor on Twitter.","Kate Winslet":"It's funny when someone says to you 'you're hot' and all that, because I don't think of it in that way.","Lindsey Stirling":"If you're public speaking, imagine yourself feeling confident; if you're nervous about a date and thinking, 'I'm gonna be a dork,' picture yourself being funny. Then it will be familiar to your brain.","Marilyn vos Savant":"Have enough sense to know, ahead of time, when your skills will not extend to wallpapering.","Dylan O'Brien":"Kissing on screen is just - funny enough, you're just acting, so you're distracted by that more than anything. Or at least I am.","Denis Leary":"What's politically correct a lot of times is not funny.","Rita Ora":"Eyebrows are really important because they structure the face. In school it was funny because I was always the one walking around with tweezers plucking my girlfriends' eyebrows. I was really good; eyebrow tweezing runs in my family - my mother used to do mine, and I picked it up.","Victoria Beckham":"What's David's role? David looks good, that's what David does. David looks good, and I'm the funny one, that's what I hear constantly. But I keep telling him that looks fade.","Gilbert Gottfried":"The pressure to being a comedian is being funny, but I've given that up, so there is no pressure whatsoever.","Tig Notaro":"My mother was a very, very funny, outrageous, outspoken person, and she never edited me. Her whole thing in my life was if anybody had a problem with me, tell them to go to hell.","Roger Ebert":"It is quite possible for the vulgar to be funny, but to succeed, it must rise to a certain genius.","Mickey Rooney":"I'm the only man in the world with a marriage licence made out to whom it may concern.","Paul Rudd":"Fear is what makes comedy funny.","Edgar Ramirez":"You get to a new school, and you're the new guy, or you're the foreigner, or you're the guy with the funny accent. That first day at school was a whole new opportunity to create a new persona.","Lena Dunham":"I never thought of myself as like, a funny person.","Kevin Systrom":"It's funny: I was a photographer before I was a programmer.","Jason Isbell":"When I hear somebody like Hayes Carll write a song that's touching and poignant and sad and funny all at the same time, it motivates me to step my game up and try to figure out a way to get more different emotions into one line or one song.","Hannibal Buress":"I just write and do what I think is funny. Sometimes, you do have it in your head about certain bits. There are certain jokes where I know if I did them in certain situations, it would irk people. There are times where I look at the news and see a story going on, and I'm like, 'Wow, if I tweeted this, I would get press if I wanted to.'","Matt Lauer":"I'm lucky: I have very funny kids.","Luke Evans":"One funny thing is, though, I wear my watch on my right hand and I'm actually right-handed. People always wonder why - I don't know myself, I've just always done it that way and I like it the way a good watch fits on my right wrist.","Carl Hiaasen":"I've always enjoyed making people laugh. But in order for me to be funny, I have to get ticked off about something.","Jean de la Bruyere":"The first day one is a guest, the second a burden, and the third a pest.","Lindsay Lohan":"It's funny because being comedic and happy and lighthearted is who I am as a person, so they're easier emotions for me to connect with.","Nina Dobrev":"Comedy is probably a lot harder for me. Maybe it's because I've been doing drama for so long or maybe it's because... you don't want to search for a laugh; you can't try to be funny, you just have to naturally be funny or be in a situation that's funny.","Connor Franta":"Making YouTube videos while I was in school, I was fortunate enough not to really have any negative repercussions from it. I had a lot of positive feedback from my friends, who thought they were great and thought they were funny and that what I was doing was really cool.","Maisie Williams":"I haven't done Vine in a long time, and when I first started, I just did stuff that I thought was funny.","Christian Bale":"I find what I do for a living really funny. I mean, acting is kind of a hilarious thing for a grown man to call a job.","John Cho":"I've been called a funny person for a long time. I don't know that I know anything about comedic acting.","Rebecca Hall":"If you imagine yourself to be someone who is very uncomfortable in their own skin, then it does funny things to your voice.","Daniel Dennett":"We adore babies because they're so cute. And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.","Sean Bean":"I have gotten a couple of letters meant for Mr. Bean aka Rowan Atkinson. These letters would say things like, 'You're so funny, you make me laugh, with your big rubbery face,' and I would say, 'You can't mean me!'","Mark Foster":"It's funny: the one time I got star-struck was when I met Snoop Dogg. I gave him a hug and said, 'I love you, man.'","Cassandra Clare":"And write what you love - don't feel pressured to write serious prose if what you like is to be funny.","Calvin Johnson":"You know what's funny? There's times when you catch a ball and really didn't even see that ball. You're like, 'That couldn't have been all me.'","James McAvoy":"The funny thing is, I've never really hurt myself in an action movie. I've done 'Wanted,' 'X-Men,' 'Welcome To The Punch,' even 'Trance' to a certain extent has little bits of action and stuff, but I've never really hurt myself at all - not even like a sprained ankle.","Daniel Craig":"I find it very easy playing Bond. I think he's hilarious. He gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations.","Mark Haddon":"Things can be funny when people are uneasy.

I mean, they are my friends.","Eric Schmidt":"The funny thing about advertising is that it's not a zero-sum game...

They said, 'Wolper, until two weeks ago, your tombstone was going to say, 'David Wolper, the man who produced 'Roots.' I think the tombstone now has a new inscription.

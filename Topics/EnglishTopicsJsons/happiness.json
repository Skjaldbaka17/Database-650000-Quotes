I can find it in the little things, like looking out into my backyard and seeing deer in the fields.","Lee Hyeon-seo":"Breathing in South Korea, even though the life here is not easy, makes me so happy.

I learned that happiness for all of us is a switch that you flick in your brain. It doesn't have anything to do with getting a new house, a new car, a new girlfriend, or a new pair of shoes. Our culture is very much about that; we are never happy with what we have today.","Gustave Flaubert":"Oh, if I had been loved at the age of seventeen, what an idiot I would be today.

But the general principle is static.","Pablo Picasso":"Never permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time.

The reason being, true happiness is not out there, true happiness lies within.","Milan Kundera":"Happiness is the longing for repetition.","Hermann Hesse":"To be able to throw one's self away for the sake of a moment, to be able to sacrifice years for a woman's smile - that is happiness.","Orison Swett Marden":"One can make no better investment than the cultivation of a taste for the beautiful, for it will bring rainbow hues and enduring joys to the whole life. It will not only greatly increase one's capacity for happiness, but also one's efficiency.","Debra Messing":"When you're passionate about something, you want it to be all it can be. But in the endgame of life, I fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection.","Chanakya":"There is no austerity equal to a balanced mind, and there is no happiness equal to contentment; there is no disease like covetousness, and no virtue like mercy.","Les Dawson":"Mind you, I've always been musical...

So it's never too late for happiness.","Plato":"The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily. This is the man of moderation, the man of manly character and of wisdom.","Bette Davis":"A sure way to lose happiness, I found, is to want it at the expense of everything else.","Liev Schreiber":"You'd think true masculinity was just calm and collected happiness. So alpha male that it needs not or worries not. But typically masculine characters are always fighting, and most violence comes from some agitated level of fear and anxiety.","Charlotte Perkins Gilman":"To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something, while to secure it in this world we must do something.","Lord Byron":"All who joy would win must share it. Happiness was born a Twin.","Maurice Sendak":"Oh, I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then, you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head, my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.","Frederick William Faber":"Kind words produce happiness.

Polk":"Well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our country's peace and prosperity, and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family.","Martin Scorsese":"When I was growing up, I don't remember being told that America was created so that everyone could get rich. I remember being told it was about opportunity and the pursuit of happiness. Not happiness itself, but the pursuit.","Paul Bloom":"Some of the natural world is appealing, some of it is terrifying, and some of it grosses us out. Modern people don't want to be dropped naked into a swamp. We want to tour Yosemite with our water bottles and G.P.S. devices. The natural world is a source of happiness and fulfillment, but only when prescribed in the right doses.","Chandra Wilson":"Our happiness is certainly mixed in with the tragedies of life. You have to find the lemonade.

Happiness can only be felt if you don't set any condition.","Garth Brooks":"Happiness isn't getting what you want, it's wanting what you got.","George Takei":"Our democracy is dependent on people who passionately cherish the ideals of a democracy.

Once the resurrection happens and we see that Jesus has risen, it's almost complete, right? It's all about the joy and the smile and the happiness and the closeness to the disciples.","Charles Baudelaire":"There are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness.","Thomas Moore":"It is only to the happy that tears are a luxury.","Tryon Edwards":"Seek happiness for its own sake, and you will not find it; seek for duty, and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine.","Douglas William Jerrold":"Happiness grows at our own firesides, and is not to be picked in strangers' gardens.","Bob Hope":"When we recall the past, we usually find that it is the simplest things - not the great occasions - that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness.","Shawn Achor":"Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success.","Elizabeth Wurtzel":"I start to think there really is no cure for depression, that happiness is an ongoing battle, and I wonder if it isn't one I'll have to fight for as long as I live.

But I always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness. But it's not really true.

Nothing can be controlled.","Jose Marti":"Happiness exists on earth, and it is won through prudent exercise of reason, knowledge of the harmony of the universe, and constant practice of generosity.","James Stephens":"Chaos is the first condition. Order is the first law. Continuity is the first reflection. Quietude is the first happiness.","David Sarnoff":"Work and live to serve others, to leave the world a little better than you found it and garner for yourself as much peace of mind as you can. This is happiness.","John Barrymore":"Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.","Vanilla Ice":"One thing I didn't understand in life was that I had $100,000,000 in the bank and I couldn't buy happiness.

It's seen a bit as being a stupid consumer.","Ellen DeGeneres":"The world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity, and a lot of judgment. I just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness. As corny as it sounds, we need to make a shift.","Rollo May":"Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings.

To the eyes you are a flickering light, to the feet, thin ice that cracks; and so may no one touch you who loves you.","Tracy Kidder":"You do the right thing even if it makes you feel bad. The purpose of life is not to be happy but to be worthy of happiness.","John Gokongwei":"Of course, the most important factor of all for long life is a good family. When a person goes home with the wife or the kids giving him endless headaches, then it's hard for that person to enjoy a long life.

In other words, freedom.","Christopher Miller":"Low expectations is the key to happiness in life.","Linda Thompson":"People get a little sidelined thinking that fame and fortune is going to bring them happiness, peace and contentment in their lives. Everyone thinks they want to be famous until the paparazzi are in their face, and then they're asking, 'Just give me some privacy.'","Philo":"Households, cities, countries, and nations have enjoyed great happiness when a single individual has taken heed of the Good and Beautiful. Such people not only liberate themselves; they fill those they meet with a free mind.","Mitch Glazer":"The thing that's really cool for me about Miami Beach is you have this dichotomy between sunlight and family and happiness and innocence and then at night, darker, stranger mob conspiracy stuff sort of comes out.

So when you attend a retreat, you have a chance to look at the deep roots of this pollution of the collective energy that is unwholesome.","Peabo Bryson":"Music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content, and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness, as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever.","Yoko Ono":"I relate to happiness as an ecstatic moment - something you don't create, you encounter.","John Ruskin":"Man's only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him. Reverence something to be worshipped by him, and love something to be cherished by him, forever.","Rush Limbaugh":"People are pursuing happiness, but they're pursuing things that will never, ever make them happy, and they don't know that. They've got a distorted view of what will make them happy, what happiness is, and it's based on what they see on television.","Russell M. Nelson":"Marriage and family are ordained of God.

Under God's great plan of happiness, families can be sealed in temples and be prepared to return to dwell in His holy presence forever.

Lang":"Heartache is very fertile ground for song-making but so is happiness, so is absolute bliss.","Marguerite Gardiner":"Happiness consists not in having much, but in being content with little.","Mike Crapo":"The Declaration calls us to recognize the inherent equality of all people.

Watson":"I have an odd theory on happiness, and it bothers people. My general theory is that happiness is a reward for an animal doing what it should be doing. So if a horse runs, it feels happy. Or if you are too thin, you can't be happy, because evolution wants you to be tense and anxious, trying to wake up in the morning looking for food.","Queen Victoria":"I think people really marry far too much; it is such a lottery after all, and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness.","Stendhal":"A wise woman never yields by appointment. It should always be an unforeseen happiness.","Joseph Butler":"Happiness does not consist in self-love.","Tom Cotton":"If men have easy access to divorce, many will choose it thoughtlessly.

But the educational system, I mean always, not just now, creates competitive, successful people, and does not educate them to be happy. The problem is that success gives money, not happiness. The eternal problem.","Ben Carson":"There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever.

Happiness should be like an oasis, the greener for the desert that surrounds it.","Cesare Beccaria":"In every human society, there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery.
